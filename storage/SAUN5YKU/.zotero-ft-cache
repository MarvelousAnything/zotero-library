MUKACHEVO, Ukraine — Ukraine and Russia say they have agreed to temporary local cease-fires to create “humanitarian corridors” for the evacuation of civilians and delivery of vital supplies, as Russian forces encircled major port cities and advanced toward other population centers.

The details of the limited cease-fires — which followed a second round of talks Thursday — are still being worked out, officials said. Ukrainian leaders are warning that food, medicine and other essentials are running low in southern cities under siege. In Kherson by the Black Sea, one official warned of disaster within days unless a corridor opened. In coastal Mariupol, near the Russian border, the mayor said residents have “no light, water and heat.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has now sent 90 percent of the forces readied around Ukraine into the country, according to a senior U.S. defense official. Russian troops are moving toward the capital, Kyiv, and the defense official said the invaders show a “clear willingness” to hit civilian targets.

More than 1 million people have fled Ukraine, according to the United Nations, an exodus that is expected to become Europe’s worst humanitarian crisis this century . U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas cited those harrowing conditions Thursday as he said tens of thousands of Ukrainian nationals already living in America would get temporary protection from deportation.

Here’s what to know

    Europe’s largest nuclear power plant caught fire after Russian forces shelled the site in southeast Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials, raising fears of a catastrophe. But the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog soon said the blaze had not affected “essential” equipment.
    Ukrainians will also be eligible for “temporary protection” within the European Union for up to three years, depending partly on conditions in Ukraine.
    The U.S. and Russian militaries have established a special line to communicate with each other through the crisis, two U.S. defense officials said Thursday.
    A senior French official said a Thursday call between Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron left Macron convinced that “the worst is yet to come” and that Putin aims to control all of Ukraine.
    The White House on Thursday announced sanctions against dozens of additional Russian elites, oligarchs and their family members.
    Russian troops seized a key government building in Kherson, the region’s governor said Thursday, and a local journalist told The Washington Post that no Ukrainian government forces have been seen in the city center since early Wednesday.

What are war crimes — and could Russia be committing them in Ukraine?

Accusations that Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine are mounting the face of Moscow’s all-out onslaught across much of the country, a rising civilian death toll and the apparent use of weapons that can put noncombatants at increased risk.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday described Russia’s artillery assault on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, as a “war crime," and called for an international tribunal to step in.

Western officials, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson , have leveled similar accusations. President Biden, though, said Wednesday that “it’s too early to say” Russian President Vladimir Putin is a war criminal.

Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron in a phone call on Thursday that Russian forces are doing “everything possible to preserve the lives of civilians,” according to a Kremlin readout.

War crimes are hard to prove — and may be particularly so in the Ukrainian context, experts say. Accountability is often elusive.

Here’s what to know about what war crimes are and how perpetrators are prosecuted.

Zaporizhzhia, a nuclear power plant, caught fire after Russian shelling, according to Ukrainian officials. The plant is located near the southeastern city of Enerhodar, Ukraine. (The Washington Post)

At approximately 1:30 a.m. local time Friday, multiple bright, white flashes illuminated the space in front of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar, as seen on a live stream of the area verified by The Washington Post.

At least eight military vehicles were positioned on the street leading directly to the plant. White and ashen-gray smoke clouded the soundless feed.

Ten minutes later, Enerhodar Mayor Dmitry Orlov posted on his Telegram channel that the power plant was on fire.

Video clips of the live stream posted as late as 11 p.m. showed an empty street — suggesting the vehicles had moved into the area before the flames.

For about an hour after 1:30 a.m., more vehicles arrived, some outside the view of the camera, and headed toward the plant. The view then panned right to show that a white building — a training center, according to Google Maps — appeared to have caught fire, with a bright blaze obscuring the entrance.

Shortly afterward, multiple munitions could be seen being fired across the screen. Two blasts appeared to make contact — the latter striking the top of the building nearest to the camera.

Several hours later, there was still activity on the scene. At 3:30 a.m., figures were seen moving in between the military vehicles, and other vehicles appeared to be driving up to the facility. Later, a crowd of people emerged, appearing to move away from the plant even as others headed toward it.

U.K. seeks emergency U.N. Security Council session on nuclear plant fire

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson early Friday demanded that Russia “cease its attack” on Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station and said he would seek an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council “in the coming hours” to discuss the fire at Europe’s largest nuclear plant in terms of power generation capacity.

London will also immediately raise the issue with Moscow, Downing Street said in a statement.

The remarks came shortly after a phone call between Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine said Russian forces had shelled the site, though the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog later said the blaze had not affected “essential” equipment and that Ukraine’s regulator reported no change in surrounding radiation levels.

Russian soccer clubs lose coaches and players as repercussions continue to mount

Days after Russian national and club soccer teams were suspended from international competition , some of those clubs have lost players and coaches in the week since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began.

Six months after landing the top job at Lokomotiv Moscow, coach Markus Gisdol quit the team on Tuesday in protest of the invasion. Ukrainian defender Yaroslav Rakitskiy requested his release from reigning Russian Premier League champion Zenit St. Petersburg, which the club granted on Wednesday. That same day, Krasnodar lost coach Daniel Farke and three of his assistants, who left the team after less than two months on the job.

Krasnodar, a team in southwestern Russia, was unable to play a league game last week because of airport closures in the region following the invasion of Ukraine. Come Thursday, eight players decamped less than 24 hours after Farke left. The group includes top players Rémy Cabella of France and Sweden’s Victor Claesson. They agreed with the club to suspend their contracts, allowing them to live and train outside of Russia, although they are still tethered to the team.

Polish teammate Grzegorz Krychowiak could reportedly join them. In a social media post last week, Krychowiak said he would boycott Poland’s World Cup qualification match against Russia, originally scheduled for later this month.

Fire broke out at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after Russian forces shelled the site in southeast Ukraine, according to plant and Ukrainian officials, who called early Friday for an immediate cease-fire and warned of a potential catastrophe.

But the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog soon said the blaze had not affected “essential” equipment and that Ukraine’s regulator reported no change in surrounding radiation levels. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted that the Energy Department was monitoring the situation but had “seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility.”

“The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” Granholm said.

A spokesman for the Zaporizhia plant said in an email that the site was “under artillery fire” and confirmed fires broke out. A live stream of the site, verified by The Washington Post, showed a white blur of flames and smoke rising into the sky early Friday morning local time. The International Atomic Energy Agency had convened an emergency meeting Wednesday as fighting closed in on the site in Enerhodar and as experts said a strike could trigger disaster.

ON THE UKRAINE-MOLDOVA BORDER — Her body was shaking as she crossed the border, a mix of cold and fear and everything she was running from. She had scarcely slept in six days. She hadn’t eaten in two. But now finally, amid the snow and chaos of volunteers, Ira Ivanitskaia and her son were safe.

She had spent the previous seven days focused on escaping the war, on getting away from the rockets she’d heard howling at night. But the cost of the conflict was about to become apparent in new ways.

“A dividing line between my old life and new,” Ira, 46, would later call it. On the new side, all she had were muddy duffel bags of clothes, a few tools she needed as a hairdresser, and two unfamiliar men flagging her down.

The volunteer van drivers.

Ira started to sob.

In Russian-allied Venezuela, protesters support Ukraine

Scores of Venezuelans on Thursday protested Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in what appears to be the first demonstration in a Russian-allied nation.

Carrying sunflowers, posters and Venezuelan and Ukrainian flags, the demonstrators screamed “Putin, you’re an assassin” and “no to the invasion,” videos shared across social media show, as they gathered in front of the European Union’s representative headquarters in Caracas.

Their message of solidarity to Ukraine was a stark contrast to the support their country has pledged to Russia — a nation that has purchased Venezuela’s oil exports and provided it with foreign aid, arms sales and loans .

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said he spoke on the phone Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin — tweeting a photo of the two shaking hands in a message blaming Ukraine’s conflict on “the destabilizing actions of NATO.” Maduro has also affirmed Venezuela would provide any military or financial support Russia requires.

But Thursday’s protest brought back parallels from 2014 — a year marked by increased solidarity between Ukrainian and Venezuelan opposition groups as they both attempted to topple their authoritarian governments .

“We will always remember how in 2014, while thousands of Venezuelans were in the streets defending democracy, our flag was raised in the streets of Ukraine in the middle of Maidan Square,” said opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who is recognized as Venezuela’s president by the United States and dozens of other nations.

During Thursday’s protest Guaidó said his government had assembled a volunteer mission to provide medical help in Ukraine’s borders. So far, he said, the group counts with 11 people who emigrated from Venezuela.

"Although it’s a modest contribution, from a country that is under a dictatorship, for us it’s deeply significant given our situation,” Guaidó said.

Russia’s last independent news station suspends broadcasts

Russia’s last independent news and radio stations folded this week as journalists and other newsroom staffers left their positions to flee their country as the war against Ukraine intensifies.

TV Rain suspended its coverage Thursday, its director general, Natalya Sindeeva, announced in a statement on the station’s website and on the air.

“We need strength to exhale and understand how to work further,” she said. “We really hope that we will return to the air and continue to work.”

Russia blocked access to the station and declared it and fellow news station Radio Echo as foreign agents for using “war” and “invasion” — terms banned by the Kremlin — in their coverage of the attack on Ukraine, the New Yorker reported.

The blocking of TV Rain portended danger for its editor in chief, Tikhon Dzyadko, who left Russia with his family as some staffers received threats, according to Current Time TV .

Radio Echo, also known as Echo of Moscow, shut down Thursday based on the decision of its board of directors, a day after Russia pushed broadcasting barriers against TV Rain’s website and social accounts, CNN reported .

    — NEXTA (@nexta_tv) March 3, 2022 

The radio station found itself facing immense scrutiny from Russia’s prosecutor general over its coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, NBC News reported.

The last seconds of TV Rain’s broadcast, after one of its journalists walked off reportedly saying “No war,” was of a black-and-white broadcast of “Swan Lake.” The choice was a nod to state television playing the performance in 1991 when the Soviet Union was on the edge of collapsing, according to NBC News.

Correction: A previous version of this report said TV Rain aired “Swan Lake” in 1991. It was the Soviet state television that broadcast the show in 1991. This version has been corrected.

Ukrainian mayors describe desperate conditions as Russia advances

MUKACHEVO, Ukraine — Russia has sent nearly all its assembled combat power into Ukraine and was moving Thursday to extend its control over the southern coast, with ground forces seizing or encircling Kherson and other strategically important cities.

Ukraine and Russia said they had agreed to temporary local cease-fires to create “humanitarian corridors” so civilians can be evacuated and food and medicine can be delivered. But the cease-fires would not apply everywhere, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said — and logistical details remained unclear.

The mayor of Mariupol said a Russian siege and hours of shelling that battered rail links and bridges had cut off water, power and food supplies to his city. And the mayor of Odessa, a major port city on the Black Sea, said the population was preparing to mount a defense amid unverified reports that a large fleet of Russian warships was heading toward the waters off the coast.

“Who are you saving us from,” Mayor Gennady Trukhanov said in a video posted online, using an expletive as he addressed Russian leaders who have said the purpose of the invasion is to save ethnic Russians and Russian-language communities in Ukraine.

U.S. grants temporary protected status to tens of thousands of Ukrainian immigrants already in the United States

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas granted temporary protection Thursday to tens of thousands of Ukrainian nationals already living inside the United States, saying the “full-scale Russian military invasion” has caused a “humanitarian crisis” that has made it unsafe for them to return.

The designation of “temporary protected status,” or TPS, will allow immigrants to live and work in this country for the next 18 months without fear of being deported, as long as they apply and pass background checks. Approximately 75,000 Ukrainian nationals are expected to be eligible to apply, according to DHS, more than double earlier estimates from lawmakers.

“Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,” Mayorkas said in a statement Thursday afternoon. “In these extraordinary times, we will continue to offer our support and protection to Ukrainian nationals in the United States.”

The U.S. and Russian militaries have established a special line to communicate with one another through the crisis spawned by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, two U.S. defense officials said Thursday, highlighting the significance of regional tensions.

The line will be used to ensure no there are miscalculations or accidents that occur outside Ukraine, where President Biden has promised U.S. troops will not be fighting, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Such lines have been used in the past, including in Syria, to keep open communication, avoid collisions among aircraft and prevent incidents that could spiral into greater conflict.

The news was first reported by NBC News.

The production company behind RT America will close up shop and lay off employees, signaling a potential end for the Kremlin-funded media outlet aimed at U.S. audiences .

Misha Solodovnikov, general manager and chief creative officer for T&R Productions, attributed the decision to “cease production” to “unforeseen business interruption events,” according to a memo he sent to employees Thursday that was reviewed by The Washington Post.

Most T&R employees, who are spread out between multiple locations in the U.S., will be laid off, he said. “We deeply regret and understand the uncertainty this action will cause our valued employees,” he wrote.

Solodovnikov’s memo was first reported by CNN and The Daily Beast . Earlier Thursday, a host for the network, Holland Cooke, broke the news of disarray at RT America in a column for industry trade publication Talkers , writing that company brass told staff in a meeting on Thursday that the network has “been canceled, by cable/satellite/online distribution platforms.”

Russian oil giant Lukoil calls for an end to conflict in Ukraine

Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil producer, on Thursday called for an end to the “tragic events in Ukraine” in a message on its website, both Bloomberg News and Reuters reported.

The company’s website appeared to be down hours after it reportedly posted a message that supported “the immediate cessation of the armed conflict and fully support its resolution through the negotiation process and through diplomatic means.”

The company did not immediately respond to questions from The Washington Post about the reported statement and issues with their site.

The online post came as the invasion entered its second week. Russian President Vladimir Putin has pressed ahead despite warnings from Western leaders of sanctions that would cripple Russia’s economy.

    I cannot verify this firsthand because I cannot open the Lukoil website from the US (tried multiple browsers and VPN), but, according to this Facebook post, the company (the second-largest company in Russia after Gazprom) just issued an anti-war statement earlier today. pic.twitter.com/kpzrUdQNRe
    — Ivan Korolev (@ivan_spartakfan) March 3, 2022 

Economic penalties — ranging from a halted gas pipeline to cutting off Russia from the international financial system — have harmed the ruble’s value, and the Moscow stock exchange closed for days. Russia appears to be on the brink of its worst economic crisis in decades.

Russian business executives — one of whom saw his yacht seized — have already expressed concern over the economic fallout, but Lukoil’s statement appears to be the first from one of Russia’s major companies.

Oil prices in the West have skyrocketed since the invasion. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil benchmark, reached $116 per barrel Thursday in premarket trading for the first time since 2008. Though the sanctions imposed do not directly target oil and gas sectors, continued fighting is expected to disrupt supply routes through Ukraine and the Black Sea.

Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer , exporting more oil than any other country. The White House has stopped short of targeting Russia’s oil and gas exports, as sanctions could further elevate the price of crude and disrupt global markets.

Still, Russia’s actions in Ukraine have prompted international oil companies such as Shell and BP to pull out of their energy investments in the country.

In the days after Russian soldiers invaded Ukraine, prompting outcry across the globe, Ike Gazaryan started receiving threatening phone calls, negative reviews and cancellations at his California restaurant.

Gazaryan, 38, owns Pushkin Russian Restaurant in San Diego, where cooks serve up classics such as beef stroganoff. Though he is Armenian — and a U.S. citizen — Gazaryan speaks Russian, enjoys that nation’s cuisine and named his seven-year-old restaurant after Russian author Alexander Pushkin.

But the ties to Russia end there. Many of his family, friends and employees are from Ukraine and he supports their fight against Russia’s invasion. Nonetheless, that hasn’t stopped strangers from calling, shouting and telling him that he is to blame for the vicious bloodshed Russian President Vladimir Putin has unleashed on Ukraine. One caller even asked why he hasn’t spoken to Putin about putting a stop to the war.

As Putin’s invasion of Ukraine intensifies, some Russian-themed businesses and Russian Americans in the United States are suddenly getting a frosty reception — and in a few cases, outright hostility. A Russian restaurant in Washington, D.C., called Russia House, was vandalized and the owner indicated that he thought anti-Russian sentiment may be to blame. Some Russian Americans say their children are being bullied at school.
