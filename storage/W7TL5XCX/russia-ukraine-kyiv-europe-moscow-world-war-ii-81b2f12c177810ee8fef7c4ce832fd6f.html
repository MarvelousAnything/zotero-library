 Russia has achieved less and struggled more than anticipated at the 
outset of the biggest land conflict in Europe since World War II. But 
the invading force of more than 150,000 troops retains large and 
possibly decisive advantages in firepower as they bear down on key 
cities.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Moscow’s 
main objective — toppling the Kyiv government and replacing it with 
Kremlin-friendly leadership — remains elusive, and its overall offensive
 has been slowed by an array of failings, including a lack of 
coordination between air and ground forces and <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-europe-nato-2d6348ea2fd973fa0c01e24acdff2908">an inability to fully dominate Ukraine’s skies</a><!-- -->.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 Pentagon on Wednesday estimated that Russia retains about 90% of the 
combat power it has deployed in Ukraine, accounting for weapons and 
vehicles destroyed or made inoperable as well as troops killed and 
wounded. Those losses, while modest at first glance, are significant for
 two weeks of fighting.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-75"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-33">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-36"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-34"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle1" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-32"></div></div></div><div class="Component-hubPeekEmbed-0-2-79 HubPeek noBorderBottom-0-2-98 compressedEmbed-0-2-99"><div data-key="feed-card-hub-peak" class="hubPeekContainerWide-0-2-101"><div class="title-0-2-102"><a class="blueTitle-0-2-103 blueTitle-1-0-2-110 overrideArticle" href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"><h3 class="title-0-2-102">Russia-Ukraine war</h3></a></div><div class="columnLayout-0-2-107"><li class="wireStoryContainer-0-2-112 noImage-0-2-113"><div class="titleContainer-0-2-115"><a class="title-0-2-116 overrideArticle" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-business-europe-5b306e611d2a7fc3d20165a54cf38062"><h4 class="headline-0-2-119">Russia-Ukraine war: Key things to know about the conflict</h4></a></div></li><li class="wireStoryContainer-0-2-112 noImage-0-2-113"><div class="titleContainer-0-2-115"><a class="title-0-2-116 overrideArticle" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-poland-crime-war-crimes-29178de14c7e444cf907d192614f1ddb"><h4 class="headline-0-2-119">'They were shooting civilians': Ukraine refugees saw abuses</h4></a></div></li><div class="divider-0-2-105"></div><div class="divider-0-2-105"></div><li class="wireStoryContainer-0-2-112 noImage-0-2-113"><div class="titleContainer-0-2-115"><a class="title-0-2-116 overrideArticle" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-bf2bcfb3a499d688e3075f2d4cf54989"><h4 class="headline-0-2-119">Russians keep pressure on Mariupol after hospital attack</h4></a></div></li><li class="wireStoryContainer-0-2-112 noImage-0-2-113"><div class="titleContainer-0-2-115"><a class="title-0-2-116 overrideArticle" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-boris-johnson-soccer-sports-business-10e0451911b5a2079e1dbbd6e71cc1c2"><h4 class="headline-0-2-119">EXPLAINER: What sanctions mean for Roman Abramovich, Chelsea</h4></a></div></li></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Two weeks of war have created <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-europe-2ddcae217a87ee66dfdfb0e5fa90bc99">a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine</a><!-- -->

 million Ukrainians have fled their country, and the number is expected

that his agency has “low confidence” in its estimate.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">With
 no sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin backing away, the war 
appears likely to drag on. CIA Director William Burns told a 
congressional panel Tuesday that <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-biden-europe-avril-haines-5c9707de86165915e7ce9d10d18464f3">Putin is frustrated</a><!-- --> and likely to “double down” in Ukraine.

 and how the conflict might expand is a major concern in the West, not 
least because Putin has said he will not tolerate unlimited U.S. or NATO
 arms supplies to Ukraine. NATO in turn has warned against the Russian 
conflict spilling over Ukraine’s border into a NATO country like Poland 
or Romania. Poland on Tuesday offered to transfer MiG-29 fighter jets to
 U.S. control at an air base in Germany, presumably leaving to 
Washington the question of whether and how to get the planes to Ukraine.
 The Pentagon quickly <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-poland-nato-5724ff192113703d829024dc4410664e">shot down the idea</a><!-- -->,
 calling it untenable in light of Ukraine’s contested airspace, and on 
Wednesday the Pentagon said it had moved two U.S. Army Patriot air 
defense units from Germany to Poland to bolster defenses against 
potential Russian threats to a NATO ally.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Some
 worry that a frustrated Putin could escalate the conflict in dangerous 
ways. A few days into the war, he invoked the prospect of nuclear war by
 announcing he had put his <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-business-europe-moscow-2e4e1cf784f22b6afbe5a2f936725550">nuclear forces on heightened alert</a><!-- -->, although U.S. officials detected no threatening changes in Russia’s nuclear posture.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“As
 he weighs an escalation of the conflict, Putin probably still remains 
confident that Russia can militarily defeat Ukraine and wants to prevent
 Western support from tipping the balance and forcing a conflict with 
NATO,” Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, told 
Congress on Tuesday.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Although
 a detailed picture of the unfolding war is difficult to acquire, 
American and European officials and analysts say the Russians started 
slowly and have since been hobbled by a combination of inadequate 
planning, flawed tactics and possibly an erosion of spirit among troops 
not ready to fight.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">On <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-russia-moscow-kyiv-626a8c5ec22217bacb24ece60fac4fe1">the opening day of the war</a><!-- -->,
 the Pentagon estimated that only about one-third of pre-staged Russian 
combat forces had entered Ukraine, with the remaining two-thirds coming 
in gradually until nearly all were in this week. The Russian troops have
 made incremental progress, but their pace has been remarkably slow.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“They
 are having morale problems,” said John Kirby, the Pentagon’s chief 
spokesman. “They are having supply problems. They are having fuel 
problems. They’re having food problems. They are meeting a very stiff 
and determined Ukrainian resistance. And we still maintain that they are
 several days behind what they probably thought they were going to be in
 terms of their progress.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Kirby
 said the Pentagon believes that the Russians’ slow pace of advance by 
ground troops has prompted them to make greater use of rockets, 
artillery and other long-range weapons, including in urban areas. That 
has resulted in more <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-lifestyle-kyiv-ed0e4c3b29d4b287afaa4e43aead4f0e">civilian casualties</a><!-- -->, he said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“We
 think it’s because, again, they have not been able to make up for the 
lost time that they continue to suffer from on the ground in terms of 
the advancement of ground forces,” Kirby said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">After
 staging more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders, the Russians 
launched their invasion Feb. 24, pressing south toward Kyiv from points 
in southern Belarus and Russia; toward Kharkiv, the largest city in 
eastern Ukraine, and north from the Crimean peninsula, which Russia has 
occupied since 2014. On Wednesday the Pentagon said Russian forces had 
made renewed advances this week on Kharkiv and the southern city of 
Mykolaiv.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Ukrainians
 mounted a fiercer resistance than Putin likely expected, even as 
Russian missile and rocket attacks on cities have caused civilian 
casualties, damaged and destroyed civilian infrastructure and triggered 
an accelerating exodus of refugees seeking safety in Poland and beyond.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Jens
 Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary-general, said Friday that Russia may 
have underestimated the degree to which Ukraine’s armed forces had 
improved since 2014 as a result of U.S. and NATO training.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“And this is the reason why they are able to push back” as effectively as they have, Stoltenberg said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Philip
 Breedlove, a retired Air Force general who was NATO’s top commander in 
Europe from 2013 to 2016, said that although Russian forces are far 
behind schedule, he believes they are capable of eventually taking Kyiv.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“Unless
 there is a big operational-level change, they have enough of what I 
call slow, steady momentum that if they can stand the losses it will 
give them, they will eventually accomplish that objective,” he said. 
That raises questions about a Russian occupation and the potential for 
an insurgency.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Breedlove
 said the Russian offensive in southern Ukraine has been less bogged 
down than in the north and is designed to establish a “land bridge” 
between the southeastern Donbas region to the Crimean peninsula and west
 to the Black Sea port city of Odesa, which would make Ukraine a 
landlocked country.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Associated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels and Nomaan Merchant in Washington contributed to this report.</p></div></div></div><div class="Component-footer-0-2-1 -footer"><div class="fluid-wrapper"><div class="Component-grid-0-2-2"><nav class="Component-nav-0-2-3"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">AP NEWS</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-news">Top Stories</a></li><li><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/videos">Video</a></li><li><a href="mailto:support@apnews.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="https://apnews.com/accessibility-statement">Accessibility Statement</a></li><li><button class="optanon-show-settings">Cookie Settings</button></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-apps-0-2-4"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Download AP NEWS</div><div class="Component-downloadDescription-0-2-11">Connect with the definitive source for global and local news</div><div class="Component-list-0-2-13"></div></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-moreFromAp-0-2-5"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">More from AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/">ap.org</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://insights.ap.org/">AP Insights</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.ap.org/">AP Definitive Source Blog</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://apimagesblog.com/">AP Images Spotlight</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/explore/">AP Explore</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/books/">AP Books</a></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-followAp-0-2-6"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Follow AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-17"><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/AP" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-twitter"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/APNews" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-facebook"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AssociatedPress" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-youtube"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/associated-press" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-linkedin"></use></svg></a></li></ol></nav><div class="Component-divider-0-2-7 Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><div class="Component-legalStuff-0-2-8 Component-legalStuff-0-2-20"><nav class="Component-legalStuffNav-0-2-21"><div class="Component-title-0-2-24 Component-spaceBelow-0-2-27">The Associated Press</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-22"><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/about/">About</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/contact-us/">Contact</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://aphelp.ap.org/">Customer Support</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/careers/">Careers</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a href="https://apnews.com/termsofservice">Terms &amp;

Compressed layout (automatic embed)\u003c/div>\u003cp>Chelsea has won five Premier League titles under Abramovich along with two Champions League titles, the latest last year. Victory in the Club World Cup last month completed the set of major honors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The success has been funded by around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) of loans to the club that Abramovich said he didn't want repaid when putting the club up for sale last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHY SANCTION ABRAMOVICH?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich has used legal means to try to publicly distance himself from benefiting from an association with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The British government thinks otherwise, saying Abramovich has obtained “a financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the government of Russia,\" including tax breaks, the sale of shares at favorable rates, and contracts in the buildup to Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich “is or has been involved in destabilizing Ukraine” via Evraz, a steel manufacturing and mining company which he effectively controls and has potentially supplied the Russia military, the government said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His fortune was made in oil and aluminium following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2005, Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom paid $13 billion for the Sibneft oil company controlled by Abramovich. It allowed Putin’s Kremlin to recapture state influence in the lucrative energy industry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON CHELSEA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The sanctions could have immediately forced Chelsea to stop running as a business, and preventing its teams from completing their seasons. Instead, a special license has been issued to allow it to continue operating, subject to heavy restrictions.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Only fans already with tickets — mainly season ticket holders — can attend matches, shutting out away fans from games. The club's shop had to close on Thursday morning. Staff at the hotel built onto Stamford Bridge said they were under orders to no longer accept new reservations or sell food and drink.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Only 500,000 pounds ($657,000) can be spent on staging each match at Stamford Bridge, including on security and catering. A maximum of 20,000 pounds can be spent on travel to matches. Chelsea plays in France at Lille in the Champions League next week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Player recruitment is also prohibited under the terms of the government license that runs through May 31. There are players with contracts expiring at the end of the season in June and the sanctions create uncertainty over whether Cesar Azpilicueta, Toni Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen could be offered new deals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>CAN CHELSEA STILL BE SOLD?\u003c/p>\u003cp>As calls grew in the British parliament for Abramovich to be sanctioned, Chelsea was put up for sale.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated,” Abramovich said. “The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>It gave the impression of being an entity that Abramovich would be involved with. The foundation could have benefited Russian victims, too.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chelsea sought potential bidders to register their interest by next week. But now the government has oversight of the process.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“While the current license does not permit the sale of the club at this time, the government is open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a new license to allow for a sale,” the government said. “Proceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"BorisJohnson","name":"Boris Johnson","canonicalName":"boris-johnson","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-sports","name":"Sports","canonicalName":"sports","isPr":false},{"id":"Soccer","name":"Soccer","canonicalName":"soccer","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-EuropeanSports","name":"Sports - Europe","canonicalName":"sports-europe","isPr":false},{"id":"London","name":"London","canonicalName":"london","isPr":false},{"id":"PremierLeague","name":"Premier League","canonicalName":"premier-league","isPr":false},{"id":"RomanAbramovich","name":"Roman Abramovich","canonicalName":"roman-abramovich","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null}],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":"Russia-Ukraine","hubPeekTagName":"Russia-Ukraine war","hubPeekCanonicalName":"russia-ukraine","hubPeekIsPr":false,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"Column List","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":"Compressed","endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null}},"loadedAt":{"afs:Card:393483284474":1646953530510},"expiration":120000},"content":{"loading":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:81b2f12c177810ee8fef7c4ce832fd6f":false},"error":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:81b2f12c177810ee8fef7c4ce832fd6f":null},"data":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:81b2f12c177810ee8fef7c4ce832fd6f":{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:81b2f12c177810ee8fef7c4ce832fd6f","shortId":"81b2f12c177810ee8fef7c4ce832fd6f","etag":"81b2f12c177810ee8fef7c4ce832fd6f_2a11aza0c0","bylines":"By ROBERT BURNS and LOLITA C.

But the invading force of more than 150,000 troops retains large and possibly decisive advantages in firepower as they bear down on key cities.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Moscow's main objective — toppling the Kyiv government and replacing it with Kremlin-friendly leadership — remains elusive, and its overall offensive has been slowed by an array of failings, including a lack of coordination between air and ground forces and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-europe-nato-2d6348ea2fd973fa0c01e24acdff2908\">an inability to fully dominate Ukraine's skies\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Pentagon on Wednesday estimated that Russia retains about 90% of the combat power it has deployed in Ukraine, accounting for weapons and vehicles destroyed or made inoperable as well as troops killed and wounded.

The United Nations estimates that 2 million Ukrainians have fled their country, and the number is expected to grow.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Russia likely has had between 2,000 and 4,000 troops killed thus far, said Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, adding that his agency has “low confidence” in its estimate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With no sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin backing away, the war appears likely to drag on. CIA Director William Burns told a congressional panel Tuesday that \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-biden-europe-avril-haines-5c9707de86165915e7ce9d10d18464f3\">Putin is frustrated\u003c/a> and likely to “double down” in Ukraine. He said that could mean “an ugly next few weeks” as the fighting intensifies.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Whether and how the conflict might expand is a major concern in the West, not least because Putin has said he will not tolerate unlimited U.S. or NATO arms supplies to Ukraine. NATO in turn has warned against the Russian conflict spilling over Ukraine's border into a NATO country like Poland or Romania. Poland on Tuesday offered to transfer MiG-29 fighter jets to U.S. control at an air base in Germany, presumably leaving to Washington the question of whether and how to get the planes to Ukraine. The Pentagon quickly \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-poland-nato-5724ff192113703d829024dc4410664e\">shot down the idea\u003c/a>, calling it untenable in light of Ukraine's contested airspace, and on Wednesday the Pentagon said it had moved two U.S. Army Patriot air defense units from Germany to Poland to bolster defenses against potential Russian threats to a NATO ally.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some worry that a frustrated Putin could escalate the conflict in dangerous ways. A few days into the war, he invoked the prospect of nuclear war by announcing he had put his \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-business-europe-moscow-2e4e1cf784f22b6afbe5a2f936725550\">nuclear forces on heightened alert\u003c/a>, although U.S. officials detected no threatening changes in Russia's nuclear posture.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“As he weighs an escalation of the conflict, Putin probably still remains confident that Russia can militarily defeat Ukraine and wants to prevent Western support from tipping the balance and forcing a conflict with NATO,” Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, told Congress on Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Although a detailed picture of the unfolding war is difficult to acquire, American and European officials and analysts say the Russians started slowly and have since been hobbled by a combination of inadequate planning, flawed tactics and possibly an erosion of spirit among troops not ready to fight.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-russia-moscow-kyiv-626a8c5ec22217bacb24ece60fac4fe1\">the opening day of the war\u003c/a>, the Pentagon estimated that only about one-third of pre-staged Russian combat forces had entered Ukraine, with the remaining two-thirds coming in gradually until nearly all were in this week. The Russian troops have made incremental progress, but their pace has been remarkably slow.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They are having morale problems,” said John Kirby, the Pentagon's chief spokesman. “They are having supply problems. They are having fuel problems. They’re having food problems. They are meeting a very stiff and determined Ukrainian resistance. And we still maintain that they are several days behind what they probably thought they were going to be in terms of their progress.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kirby said the Pentagon believes that the Russians' slow pace of advance by ground troops has prompted them to make greater use of rockets, artillery and other long-range weapons, including in urban areas. That has resulted in more \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-lifestyle-kyiv-ed0e4c3b29d4b287afaa4e43aead4f0e\">civilian casualties\u003c/a>, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We think it’s because, again, they have not been able to make up for the lost time that they continue to suffer from on the ground in terms of the advancement of ground forces,” Kirby said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After staging more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, the Russians launched their invasion Feb. 24, pressing south toward Kyiv from points in southern Belarus and Russia; toward Kharkiv, the largest city in eastern Ukraine, and north from the Crimean peninsula, which Russia has occupied since 2014. On Wednesday the Pentagon said Russian forces had made renewed advances this week on Kharkiv and the southern city of Mykolaiv.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ukrainians mounted a fiercer resistance than Putin likely expected, even as Russian missile and rocket attacks on cities have caused civilian casualties, damaged and destroyed civilian infrastructure and triggered an accelerating exodus of refugees seeking safety in Poland and beyond.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary-general, said Friday that Russia may have underestimated the degree to which Ukraine's armed forces had improved since 2014 as a result of U.S. and NATO training.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“And this is the reason why they are able to push back\" as effectively as they have, Stoltenberg said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Philip Breedlove, a retired Air Force general who was NATO's top commander in Europe from 2013 to 2016, said that although Russian forces are far behind schedule, he believes they are capable of eventually taking Kyiv.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Unless there is a big operational-level change, they have enough of what I call slow, steady momentum that if they can stand the losses it will give them, they will eventually accomplish that objective,” he said. That raises questions about a Russian occupation and the potential for an insurgency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Breedlove said the Russian offensive in southern Ukraine has been less bogged down than in the north and is designed to establish a “land bridge” between the southeastern Donbas region to the Crimean peninsula and west to the Black Sea port city of Odesa, which would make Ukraine a landlocked country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels and Nomaan Merchant in Washington contributed to this report.\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"reporterKeys":["afs:Reporter:593677570691","afs:Reporter:395980556212"],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false,"canonicalUrl":"russia-ukraine-kyiv-europe-moscow-world-war-ii","urlUpdated":null}},"loadedAt":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:81b2f12c177810ee8fef7c4ce832fd6f":1646953530444},"expiration":120000},"medium":{"loading":{},"error":{},"data":{"667a38aa09d54f25ade0521905c62c7e":{"id":"667a38aa09d54f25ade0521905c62c7e","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>FILE - An armed man stands by the remains of a Russian military vehicle in Bucha, close to the capital Kyiv, Ukraine, March 1, 2022.
