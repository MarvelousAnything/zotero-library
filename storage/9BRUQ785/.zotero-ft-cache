What Happened on Day 4 of Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine

Fierce Ukrainian resistance continued to keep Russian forces from gaining control of key cities. World opposition to the Russian invasion hardened, with the E.U. banning Russian aircraft from its airspace.

Here’s the latest news from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

As Ukraine’s second largest city reeled under a barrage of Russian rockets that left dozens of people dead, officials said, a Ukrainian delegation met counterparts from Russia on Monday in Belarus for talks that held little hope for an immediate end to the fighting that has sparked a nationwide resistance in Ukraine and left Russia’s economy increasingly isolated from the world.

Among Monday’s major developments:

    The leader of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, hosted the first face-to-face talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials since the Russian invasion began, but President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said before the meeting that he was not hopeful that it would end the hostilities.

    The Treasury Department announced that it would freeze assets of the Russian Central Bank that are held in the United States and impose sanctions on the Russian Direct Investment Fund. The value of the ruble plunged by more than 25 percent as the effects of Western sanctions shook Russia’s economy.

    Ukrainian officials accused Russian forces of launching a barrage of rockets on a residential neighborhood in Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, killing dozens of civilians.

MOSCOW — The ruble cratered, the stock market froze and the public rushed to withdraw cash on Monday as Western sanctions kicked in and Russia awoke to uncertainty and fear over the rapidly spreading repercussions of President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

As the day began, Russia’s currency lost as much as a quarter of its value within hours. Scrambling to stem the decline, the Russian Central Bank more than doubled its key interest rate, banned foreigners from selling Russian securities and ordered exporters to convert into rubles most of their foreign-currency revenues. It closed the Moscow stock exchange for the day because of the “developing situation.”

“The economic reality has, of course, changed,” the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters, announcing that Mr. Putin had called an emergency meeting with his top finance officials.

Even as Russian and Ukrainian delegations met for talks at the Belarus border, Moscow’s military offensive showed no sign of letting up, and the hectic moves offered the first signs that the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West over the weekend were shaking the foundations of Russia’s economy. The decisions by the United States, Britain and the European Union restricting the Russian Central Bank’s access to much of its $643 billion in foreign currency reserves have undone much of the Kremlin’s careful efforts to soften the impact of potential sanctions.

And with dozens of countries closing their airspace to Russian planes, major foreign investors pulling out and the West placing debilitating restrictions on Russia’s biggest banks, it was becoming clear that Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was ushering in a period of international isolation for Russia unseen since the Cold War.

“So, has Russia become Venezuela or is it still Iran?” the morning-show host on the liberal-leaning Echo of Moscow radio station asked an economist on Monday.

“We’ll go through the Iran phase,” Yevgeny S. Gontmakher of Moscow’s Higher School of Economics responded, referring to sanctions placed on Iran because of its plans for uranium enrichment, “but what happens after that is hard to say.”

Elvira Nabiullina, the widely respected governor of the Russian Central Bank, was expected to speak to the public at 4 p.m. Moscow time.

On Sunday, Mr. Putin called the West’s sanctions “illegitimate” in a televised meeting with his defense minister and top military commander. Mr. Putin then told them to place Russia’s nuclear arsenal on high alert; some analysts fear that Russia’s economic instability could lead Mr. Putin to escalate his conflict with the West using new military threats or other means, such as cyberattacks.

But there was also extreme uncertainty inside Russia as the value of people’s savings evaporated and the interconnections with the Western world that Russians had come to take for granted in the last three decades rapidly broke away. It was not immediately clear whether most Russians would blame Mr. Putin for the crisis — or whether they would take cues from Kremlin propaganda and blame the West.

“Times change, much has happened, but one thing has not changed,” a reporter on the state-run news channel Rossiya 24 said on Sunday. “When a united Europe tried to destroy Russia, this always ended up bringing about the opposite result.”

Heavy artillery, multi-launch rocket systems and airstrikes are responsible for most of the civilian casualties in fighting since Russia invaded Ukraine, the United Nations’ top human rights official said. Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said that by Sunday night her office had recorded 102 civilian deaths, including seven children, and more than 300 people injured. “The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher,” Ms. Bachelet told the Human Rights Council in Geneva.

The European subsidiary of one of Russia’s biggest banks was on the verge of collapse Monday as punishing Western sanctions took a toll. Sberbank Europe AG, domiciled in Austria, and its subsidiaries in Croatia and Slovenia “experienced significant outflows of deposits due to the impact of geopolitical tensions on their reputation,” and were “failing or likely to fail,” the European Central Bank said. The bank, which held €13.6 billion in assets at the end of last year, was likely to go bankrupt imminently, the central bank added.

The British military said that the bulk of the Russian forces attacking Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, were some 18 miles north of the city and were being slowed by the Ukrainian army’s fierce defense of the Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective. In an early-morning statement released on Twitter, the British Defense Intelligence agency reported that fierce fighting continued around the cities of Chernihiv and Kharkiv, but both remained under Ukrainian control.

Steps by the United States and its allies to target some Russian banks for the country’s invasion of Ukraine jarred Russia’s financial system on Monday, with its currency falling by more than 30 percent against the dollar.

The fall of the ruble is likely to worsen inflation in Russia, and it has heightened fears of bank runs in the country. Russia’s central bank said over the weekend that it would support Russian financial institutions that had been hit with sanctions and that banks would continue to be able to carry out transactions in rubles and foreign currency.

On Monday, the central bank took further steps, raising its key interest rate to 20 percent from 9.5 percent to try to control the damage from the sanctions. The bank also said it would release about $7 billion worth of bank reserves that had been set aside as a buffer for unsecured consumer and mortgage loans.

In another effort to prop up the ruble, Russia’s finance ministry also said Monday that it would require companies to sell 80 percent of their foreign currency holdings.

Last week, the United States, Europe and other allies took steps to exclude some Russian banks from international transactions by removing them from the SWIFT financial messaging system. At the same time, the United States and several allies announced they would move to prevent Russia’s central bank from deploying its reserves to undermine the sanctions.

The drop early Monday put the ruble at record levels, trading as low as 120 per dollar, although the currency had recovered somewhat by afternoon trading in Asia.

A crash of the currency would add to the pain that average Russians may feel from the sanctions. Inflation would be pushed even higher, and the prices of imported goods would surge.

Russia’s central bank tried to project calm over the weekend, saying that the banking system was stable and that it would continue to provide banks with cash to ensure normal operations. It said that services would be normal and that all bank cards would work.

Singapore announced on Monday that it was imposing sanctions on Russia. The country’s minister for foreign affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, announced in Parliament that Singapore “will also block certain Russian banks and financial transactions connected to Russia.” Singapore has rarely acted to impose sanctions on other countries without a binding U.N. Security Council decision, he said, but “given the unprecedented gravity of the Russian attack on Ukraine,” Singapore would act in concert with “many other like-minded countries to impose appropriate sanctions and restrictions against Russia.”

Facebook’s parent company says it shut down digital operations targeting Ukraine.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, said Sunday night that it had shut down influence and hacking campaigns targeting its users in Ukraine. The efforts were tied to people in Russia and Ukraine, as well as to a hacking group thought to be affiliated with Belarus, Meta executives said.

One operation spread links to misleading news articles that claimed Ukraine was a “failed state,” and included messages of support for the Russian government. Meta said it found evidence the effort was linked to another operation the company had disclosed in 2020 that included two publishers, News Front and South Front. The publishers operate out of Crimea and have long been used to spread propaganda targeting enemies of the Kremlin.

The influence network engaged in what Facebook calls “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” or groups of Facebook accounts and pages that operate under false names and fake profile photos to spread targeted messages across the platform.

The campaign received fewer than 5,000 followers across Facebook and Instagram before being taken offline, Meta officials said.

Meta said the disinformation campaign was active on other social media platforms, including Twitter, YouTube, the European social network VK, the Russian social platform Odnoklassniki and the chat app Telegram.

A Twitter spokeswoman said the company had removed more than a dozen accounts that participated in the campaigns and blocked several links from being shared on Twitter. “The accounts and links originated in Russia and were attempting to disrupt the public conversation around the ongoing conflict in Ukraine,” the Twitter spokeswoman said.

YouTube said in a statement on Monday morning that it had shut down five channels with less than 90 subscribers as part of its investigation into a coordinated influence operation linked to Russia.

Meta said it had also detected a hacking operation that targeted military leaders and politicians in Ukraine, as well as at least one journalist. The effort, which Meta said was linked to the hacking group Ghostwriter, attempted to take over these high-profile accounts and then use them to spread disinformation.

Ghostwriter has targeted politicians in Eastern Europe for several years, often pushing narratives that oppose NATO and the United States. The hacking group was long thought to be affiliated with Russia. But in November, the threat intelligence firm Mandiant discovered that the group was linked to Belarus.

“Ghostwriter has previously targeted the NATO alliance, seeking to erode support for the organization,” Ben Read, a director at Mandiant, said in a statement. “I wouldn’t be surprised if similar operations were seen in the near future.”

A small number of high-profile individuals were targeted, and several Facebook accounts were compromised, Meta executives said. Some posts on those accounts attempted to portray the Ukrainian military surrendering, sharing videos of soldiers walking out of a forest waving a white flag. Facebook was able, in some cases, to block the hackers from posting.

“Historically, what we’ve seen from Ghostwriter is targeting of military, public figures, journalists and politicians across Europe,” said David Agranovich, a director of threat disruption at Meta. “Since the invasion, we’ve seen a pivot in Ghostwriter’s focus to people in Ukraine.”

Meta is among a number of Silicon Valley social media companies under pressure as Russian operatives attempt to spread digital propaganda campaigns across the internet in tandem with President Vladimir V. Putin’s siege of Ukraine.

Meta has focused on taking action against entities that violate the company’s policies regulating behavior on its platforms. Meta, YouTube and Twitter have also blocked Russian state media outlets from monetizing their pages on the platforms.

Australia pledges $3 million to NATO fund and imposes sanctions on Belarus’s defense minister.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia said in a statement released Monday that his government would contribute $3 million toward the supply of nonlethal military equipment and medical supplies to Ukraine through a fund set up by NATO for the country.

The announcement followed news on Sunday that Australia planned to send lethal weapons to the Ukrainian government as it tries to hold off the Russian advance. Details of that arrangement, Mr. Morrison said on Monday, would be announced shortly.

The Australian government has imposed sanctions on more than 350 Russians and 13 Belarussians, said Mr. Morrison. Included on that list is Viktor Khrenin, the Belarusian minister of defense. Mr. Morrison said the official had “aided and abetted Putin’s aggression” by allowing Russia to launch attacks from Belarus.

“The Australian Government is deeply concerned at Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, which is a gross violation of international law and the United Nations Charter,” said Mr. Morrison, adding that targeted financial sanctions and travel bans against Putin and the remaining permanent members of Russia’s Security Council had come into effect.

Australia has also promised to prioritize visas for people fleeing Ukraine, but has not specified how many will be granted.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a late-night meeting with his top officials on the plight of the country’s citizens stranded in Ukraine, as videos emerged of students stuck at jammed border crossings in cold weather and falling snow.

About 4,000 Indian citizens left Ukraine before Russia’s invasion began, but about 15,000 remain stranded in the country, India’s foreign secretary, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, told reporters late Sunday. So far, the Indian government has managed to evacuate about 2,000 of them through border crossings with Ukraine’s neighboring countries.

When Western governments announced on Friday their intention to freeze assets belonging to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as punishment for invading Ukraine, there was no indication they knew of significant holdings that could be tied to him.

In fact, very little is known about what Mr. Putin owns and where it could be. Despite years of speculation and rumor, the extent of his wealth remains maddeningly opaque, even as billions of dollars have sluiced through the accounts of his close friends and luxury properties have been connected to family members.

Officially, Mr. Putin earns about $140,000 a year and owns a small apartment, according to his public financial disclosures.

But that would not account for “Putin’s Palace,” a vast estate on the Black Sea estimated to have cost more than $1 billion, with a Byzantine ownership history that does not include the Russian president but has been linked to his government in various ways. Nor would the disclosures account for “Putin’s Yacht,” a $100 million luxury vessel long tied to him in speculative news reports. (The yacht, Graceful, was tracked leaving Germany for Russia just weeks before the invasion of Ukraine.)

There is also the $4.1 million apartment in Monaco, purchased through an offshore company by a woman reported to be Mr. Putin’s lover . And there is the expensive villa in the South of France linked to his ex-wife.

The problem for the United States and its allies is that none of these assets can be directly connected to the Russian president.

Bearing blue and yellow Ukrainian flags, singing patriotic songs and shouting chants against Russia’s president, thousands of protesters gathered at rallies across the country on Sunday in a show of support for Ukraine.

In Washington, Chicago, Boston and other cities, the crowds varied in size, but the number of gatherings, which followed several on Saturday and came days after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered troops to invade Ukraine, spoke to the level of concern in communities throughout the nation.

Many attendees expressed their love for their Ukrainian homeland. Some argued for more U.S. involvement in the conflict. Some vented their anger and called for harsher penalties against Mr. Putin. Other protesters wanted to make sure that the public’s awareness of the war didn’t fade.

Irene Griffin, a 47-year-old Ukrainian-American who drove to a rally in Washington from Lorton, Va., with her husband and two children, stood in front of the White House fence holding small American and Ukrainian flags. Her grandparents fled Ukraine in 1945 during World War II before arriving in the United States three years later.

“I’m very hopeful,” Ms. Griffin said. “Ukrainian people don’t give up hope.”

For weeks, a Russian invasion had been expected by some Ukrainians and merely sequestered in the mind’s recesses by others. But once the sweeping attacks began on Thursday, hitting seemingly every corner of the country, the war became unavoidably tangible for Ukrainians — a hovering cloud of darkness that once seemed unimaginable in the post-Cold War era. These images are a visual documentation of a populace coping with the initial stages of a national military invasion, struggling with newfound uncertainty and fear.

The Metropolitan Opera said on Sunday that it would no longer engage with performers or other institutions that have voiced support for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, becoming the latest cultural organization to seek to distance itself from some Russian artists amid Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine .

Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said that the Met, which has long employed Russians as top singers and has a producing partnership with the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow, had an obligation to show support for the people of Ukraine.

“While we believe strongly in the warm friendship and cultural exchange that has long existed between the artists and artistic institutions of Russia and the United States,” Mr. Gelb said in a video statement, “we can no longer engage with artists or institutions that support Putin or are supported by him.”

Mr. Gelb added that the policy would be in effect “until the invasion and killing has been stopped, order has been restored, and restitutions have been made.”

The Met’s decision could affect artists like the superstar soprano Anna Netrebko, who has ties to Mr. Putin and was once pictured holding a flag used by some Russian-backed separatist groups in Ukraine. Ms. Netrebko is scheduled to appear at the Met in Puccini’s “Turandot” beginning on April 30.

Ms. Netrebko has tried to distance herself from the invasion, posting a statement on Saturday on Instagram saying she was “opposed to this war.” She added a note of defiance, writing that “forcing artists, or any public figure, to voice their political opinions in public and to denounce their homeland is not right.”

It was unclear if her statement would satisfy the Met’s new test.

The company’s decision will also likely mean the end of its collaboration with the Bolshoi, including on a new production of Wagner’s “Lohengrin” that is scheduled for next season. The Met was relying on the Bolshoi for the staging’s sets and costumes, but now it might have to change course.

“We’re scrambling, but I think we’ll have no choice but to physically build our own sets and costumes,” Mr. Gelb said in an interview on Sunday evening.

He added that he was saddened that the Bolshoi partnership, which began five years ago, would likely come to an end — at least for the moment.

“It’s terrible that artistic relationships, at least temporarily, are the collateral damage of these actions by Putin,” he said.

The Met’s decision comes as performing arts institutions grapple with the ongoing fallout from Mr. Putin’s invasion. In recent days Russian artists, long ubiquitous in classical music, have come under pressure to condemn Mr. Putin’s actions or face the prospect of canceled engagements.

Carnegie Hall and the Vienna Philharmonic last week dropped two Russian artists, the conductor Valery Gergiev and the pianist Denis Matsuev, from a series of planned concerts because of the two men’s ties to Mr. Putin. Mr. Gergiev is also in peril of losing several key posts, including as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic and as honorary conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra.

On Sunday, Mr. Gergiev’s manager announced he was ending his relationship with his client.

“It has become impossible for us, and clearly unwelcome, to defend the interests of Maestro Gergiev, one of the greatest conductors of all time, a visionary artist loved and admired by many of us, who will not, or cannot, publicly end his long-expressed support for a regime that has come to commit such crimes,” the manager, Marcus Felsner, who is based in Munich, said in a statement.

The Royal Opera House in London said on Friday it would cancel a residency by the Bolshoi Ballet planned for this summer.

The United Nations Security Council voted Sunday to convene a rare special session of the General Assembly to address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The move came as President Vladimir V. Putin declared that he had placed Russia’s nuclear defense system on high alert.

The General Assembly has held a special session only 10 times since 1950, and Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador, said the vote to do so showed that “this is no ordinary moment.”

“Just this morning, President Putin put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert, even though he is invading a country with no nuclear weapons and is under no threat from NATO,” she said, calling it “another escalatory and unnecessary step that threatens us all.”

Eleven of the Security Council’s 15 members voted in favor of the resolution on Sunday. Russia voted against it but could not veto the move, as it was a procedural vote. China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstained, as they had for a resolution last week condemning the invasion.

When the General Assembly session is convened — probably Wednesday, the French ambassador said — a vote on a resolution criticizing Russia and calling for an end to the war is expected. It would not be legally binding but would carry political weight as part of a larger effort to isolate and shame Russia on the world stage.

Other diplomatic actions are also planned at the United Nations this week.

The Security Council will meet Monday, at the request of President Emmanuel Macron of France, to discuss the dire humanitarian situation unfolding in Ukraine. The United Nations’ top refugee and emergency aid officials will brief the Council the same day.

On Tuesday, the Council plans to vote on a resolution put forth by France and Mexico that calls for hostilities to end immediately, civilians to be protected and humanitarian aid to have unconditional safe passage to Ukraine, said the French ambassador, Nicolas de Rivière.

“We all want negotiations to take place,” he told reporters at the United Nations on Sunday. “The crisis is very deep, and we need to provide support to Ukraine.”

Russia’s ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, accused the West of scheming and pressuring countries to “push through” actions against Russia rather than finding common ground, saying they “disregard our legitimate concerns.”

Mr. Nebenzia dismissed as “lies, deceits and fakes” reports that Russia’s military had shelled and attacked civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.

The Ukrainian ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said that his country had always “hoped for peace talks” and that a delegation was trying to find a safe route to the Belarus border for negotiations.

He told the Council that Mr. Putin “has resorted to open nuclear blackmail” and that the world must heed this “very threatening” act.

Oil prices climb as Ukraine crisis deepens.

Oil prices jumped on Monday, as President Vladimir V. Putin’s saber-rattling order to put his country’s nuclear forces on high alert overshadowed hopes for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.

The announcement by President Volodymyr Zelensky that a Ukrainian delegation would meet with a Russian delegation near the Ukraine-Belarus border for talks “without preconditions” was viewed skeptically by oil traders and most political analysts and Western officials.

Traders had not driven up prices in recent days because Western sanctions against Russia have so far not impeded the export of oil and natural gas to Western Europe. But the Brent oil benchmark climbed more than 3 percent Monday to $101 a barrel while the American West Texas Intermediate benchmark climbed to above $95 a barrel.

American gasoline prices have risen about a penny a gallon every day over the last week, according to surveys by the AAA motor club. At $3.61 a gallon for regular gasoline, the national average is nearly a dollar higher than it was a year ago.

Risks of rising energy prices remain high as the Russians press on with their invasion of Ukraine. In the early days, the Russian offensive bogged down in the face of strong resistance from the Ukrainian armed forces and Ukrainian citizens.

Bombing and rockets could damage vital pipelines that run through Ukraine, though that has not happened yet. Some Republican leaders and members of Congress of both parties are pressing for tougher sanctions on energy transactions. Western oil companies may decide that doing business with Russia is not worth the risks, especially if Western technology and oil services are either hit with sanctions or because financial sanctions will impede Russian payments.

“Perhaps the greatest uncertainty will be the Russian response,” according to a report released by RBC Capital Markets on Sunday. “The central bank sanctions will sharply reduce Russia’s access to its foreign exchange reserve war chest and proceeds from oil sales in overseas accounts.”

The West’s tough economic stance against Russia is already having an effect. BP said on Sunday that it would “exit” its nearly 20 percent stake in Rosneft , the giant Russian company, and remove its two representatives from the Rosneft board. It was a climactic retreat for the British-based company after three decades of doing business in Russia.

Ukraine’s gas pipeline operators said on Sunday that natural gas transmission that goes through the country to much of the rest of Europe was normal.

Another wild card will be Russia’s stance at a meeting on Wednesday of OPEC Plus, in which it is a partner with Saudi Arabia and other major producers. The group is meeting to discuss how much to increase production to ease global price increases. Washington so far has had little success in pressing the group to raise production.

Much of the attention in the first days of the war has been on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and other large cities. But in the villages of the Vinnytsya region in the country’s center, a grass-roots movement was taking shape as civilians — farmers, shop owners, day laborers, taxi drivers — took up arms to join a battle that has abruptly upended their lives.

In Hushchyntsi on Sunday, about 50 people assembled Molotov cocktails and piled logs and sandbags into makeshift bunkers, as children ran about and women carried out homemade meals.

“Step away, you might get hurt, that’s the job for grown-ups,” one man told the children hoping to participate.

LONDON — Rows of boots, helmets and rucksacks lined the sidewalk in north London in front of the Ukrainian Social Club. Dozens of volunteers hustled in and out of the building, their arms heavy with donations.

On Sunday night, they were busy packing boxes with everything from first aid kits and tourniquets to diapers and painkillers, all destined for Ukraine.

“Everyone in Ukraine is writing to say they don’t have the supplies for first aid,” said Iryna Estevez, one of the volunteers.

The social club in north London has long been at the heart of the city’s Ukrainian community. But since Russia invaded Ukraine last week, it has turned into a makeshift staging site for the supplies pouring in from expatriates to be sent back home.

Men and women wearing the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag gathered around tables to share food and drinks, and to talk about what comes next. Nearly everyone here had a family member or loved one impacted by the war.

A room off the basement bar and lounge that advertised the club’s famed borscht and potato dumplings had become a logistics hub. In a community hall at the back of the building that normally hosts parties or fund-raisers, the floor was covered in bags of donations.

Oleksander Bakhur, 34, who was born in Ukraine but has lived in Britain for 17 years, was sorting vests to be shipped to the border. He said that his mother still lived in Ukraine and that he was worried about her safety.

“It’s horrifying, it’s scary,” he said, adding, “For everyone here, it’s personal.”

Many of the people gathered here had taken part in a protest at Trafalgar Square earlier in the day that drew thousands.

Most were glued to their phones, fielding frantic messages from friends and relatives back home or scrolling social media for the latest updates. One woman waved over another to look at a photo of Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain attending a Mass on Sunday evening in a Ukrainian church in London.

Some who had come said they were considering traveling to Ukraine to take up arms, including Dima Chuprynyuk, 28.

“I’m torn if I should be here or be there to help,” he said, but he said he was leaning toward returning to fight.

The full impact of the sanctions imposed on Russia’s central bank by the United States and the European Commission remains unclear, but their threat is already looming over markets. “Regardless of the actual details and material impact, it could unleash the mother of all financial panics in Moscow on Monday,” said Adam Tooze, director of the European Institute at Columbia University.

The war has forced Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary to reset his political calculations.

ZAHONY, Hungary — A dusty town with a train station in northeastern Hungary, near the border with Slovakia and Ukraine, has become a transit point for people fleeing Russia’s war against Ukraine. It also has thrown a wrench into the political calculations of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Hungary’s illiberal, Russia-friendly, anti-immigrant strongman.

Nearly 80,000 people have crossed into Hungary, at Zahony and other towns along the 84-mile border with Ukraine, since President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered his forces into Ukraine last Thursday in the biggest military action to convulse Europe since World War II.

In other circumstances, Mr. Orban’s hard-line refugee policy would have made it impossible for so many people entering the country to get international protection.

But Russia’s growing isolation and the enormous outcry against its invasion of Ukraine have forced Mr. Orban onto a political tightrope. Just a few weeks before Russia invaded, Mr. Orban visited Mr. Putin in Moscow for an amiable meeting , describing Russia’s security demands as reasonable and denouncing Western sanctions as counterproductive.

Now, Mr. Orban is treading a fine line in trying not to antagonize his friend Mr. Putin, anger Hungary’s partners in the NATO alliance and the European Union, or alienate voters just as an election is approaching.

Polls suggest his party has a slight lead over a six-party opposition alliance.

“The Orban regime wants to solve this situation by sending all possible messages to everyone, from the hard-core pro-Atlanticists to the hard-core Russia supporters,” said Peter Kreko, director of Political Capital, a research organization in Budapest. “Everyone can cherry-pick a narrative.”

While Mr. Orban appeared to have softened his anti-immigrant position over the past few days, his government is not bending over backward to help evacuees from Ukraine fleeing to Hungary for protection. Most of the aid given to them has been organized by charities and nongovernmental groups.

Ukraine has filed a lawsuit against Russia in the United Nations’ top court, accusing it of planning a genocide of Ukrainians.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, wrote Sunday on Twitter : “Russia must be held accountable for manipulating the notion of genocide to justify aggression. We request an urgent decision ordering Russia to cease military activity now.”

Ukraine asked the International Court of Justice, based in The Hague, to order Moscow provisionally to halt its military operations in Ukraine, in order to prevent “irreparable prejudice to the rights of Ukraine and its people” and to avoid “aggravating” the dispute between the two countries, both parties to the Genocide Conventions.

It also disputed Russia’s claims of genocide organized by Ukraine in the Luhansk and Donetsk separatist regions, which the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, used as a justification for the invasion.

Ukraine “emphatically denies” that any such genocide has occurred and asked the court “to establish that Russia has no lawful basis to take action in and against Ukraine for the purpose of preventing and punishing any purported genocide.”

The International Court of Justice rules on disputes among United Nations member nations over questions of international law, and although its orders are legally binding, governments do not always comply with them.

Ukraine sued Russia in 2017 in the court, accusing it of supplying funds, weapons and training to illegal armed groups in the eastern Donbass region and of discriminating against the Crimean Tatar and ethnic Ukrainian communities in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. That case is continuing, and the final judgment could take several years, but the court granted some provisional measures to Ukraine in 2019, including that the Ukrainian language be used in education.

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund plans to divest from the Russian market.

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund is freezing its assets in Russia and plans to divest from the Russian market, a spokeswoman for the fund said Sunday.

The $1.3 trillion fund — the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund — held 27 billion kroner, equivalent to roughly $3 billion, in assets in Russia at the end of 2021. Its Russian investments equaled 0.2 percent of the fund.

The operator of the fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, will neither buy nor sell shares in Russian assets, according to Line Aaltvedt, the fund’s spokeswoman. The fund will work with the Ministry of Finance to prepare a plan to divest from the Russian market. No timeline for the divestment was given.

The announcement on Sunday was part of a fleet of measures by the Norwegian government in support of Ukraine, including joining European Union sanctions and allocating up to 2 billion kroner for humanitarian aid. On Sunday, the E.U. also announced that it would finance the provision of weapons to Ukraine and ban Russian aircraft from E.U. airspace.

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund was created in the 1990s to invest the country’s oil and gas revenue abroad. Since 2004, it has operated under ethical guidelines including bans on investing in companies that sell certain weapons.
