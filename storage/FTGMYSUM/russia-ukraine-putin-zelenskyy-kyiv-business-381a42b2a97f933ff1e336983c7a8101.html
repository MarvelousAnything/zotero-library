 — The costs of economic recovery and reconstruction for war-torn 
Ukraine are “already massive” and will require swift aid as Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine continues, the head of the International Monetary 
Fund said Thursday.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">IMF
 Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva spoke a day after the 
190-country organization approved $1.4 billion in emergency lending for 
Ukraine to meet urgent needs and help blunt the economic impact of the 
invasion. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The 
emergency IMF aid comes atop $700 million disbursed to Ukraine in 
December and $2.7 billion in emergency reserves Ukraine received in 
August as part of its normal IMF allocation. The organization provides 
loans and other financial support to countries in crisis to help restore
 economic and financial stability.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Ukrainian
 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s top economic adviser on Thursday put 
the cost of recovery and reconstruction at $100 billion at least. 
Georgieva said it’s too early to accurately assess costs, but 
acknowledged they could be close to that.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">For
 Russia, Georgieva said the unprecedented economic and financial 
sanctions leveled by the U.S. and European allies have brought severe 
economic disruption, staggering inflation and damage to the Russian 
people’s standard of living. A deep recession is certain, she said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">UNITED

having to do with nuclear facilities.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Grossi
 said he does not expect any side to intentionally target nuclear

stressed that at facilities taken by the Russian military, but operated 
by Ukrainian staff, it was paramount that employees get enough rest to 
be focused while working. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Grossi

 a reversal from a Feb. 6 Yad Vashem letter to U.S. ambassador Tom Nides
 urging the U.S. not to sanction Abramovich because of “potentially
