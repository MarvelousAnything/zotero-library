THE ORIGINS AND EVOLUTION OF PREDATOR-PREY THEORY'

ALAN A. BERRYMAN Departments of Entomology and Natural Resource Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington 99164 USA

Abstract. Predator-prey theory is traced from its origins in the Malthus-Verhulst logistic equation, through the Lotka-Volterra equations, logistic modifications to both prey and predator equations, incorporation of the Michaelis-Menten-Holling functional response into the predator and prey equations, and the recent development of ratio-dependent functional responses and per-capita rate of change functions. Some of the problems of classical predator-prey theory, including the paradoxes of enrichment and biological control, seem to have been caused by the application of the principle of mass action to predatorprey interactions. Predator-prey models that evolved from logistic theory or that incorporate ratio-dependent functional responses do not have these problems and also seem to be more biologically plausible.
Key words: logistic; Lotka- Volterra, predator-prey interactions; ratio dependence.

INTRODUCTION

burg 1989, Arditi and Berryman 1991). In this paper

The dynamical relationship between predators and their prey is one of the dominant themes in ecology. Yet the theory of predator-prey interactions has some notable problems: One is the "paradox of enrichment," where classical models predict that enriching the system will cause an increase in the equilibrium density of the predator but not in that of the prey (Hairston, Smith, and Slobodkin 1960), and will destabilize the community equilibrium (Rosenzweig 1969). These predictions, however, are not always in line with field

I briefly sketch the origin and evolution of population theory and, in particular, predator-prey models. My objectives are twofold: First, to show how conventional predator-prey models deviated significantly from earlier theory, and how this may have led to some of their problems. Second, to show how ratio-dependent predator-prey theory follows logically from basic concepts of single-species population dynamics, and how this viewpoint solves many of the problems and paradoxes of traditional predator-prey theory.

LOTKA-VOLTERRA PREDATOR-PREY THEORY
Lotka's Elements of Physical Biology (Lotka 1925) was the next major advance in population dynamics theory. Not only did Lotka derive the logistic equation, which he called the "law of population growth," from first principles, but he also proposed the first model of trophic (predator-prey) interactions. However, instead of developing the predator-prey model by extending the logistic "law" to two species he, and soon afterwards Volterra (1928, as translated in Chapman 1931), adopted the chemical principle of mass action. In other words, he assumed that the response of the populations would be proportional to the product of their biomass densities so that
dN/dt = aN - bNP, (2a)
dP/dt = cNP - dP, (2b)
where N and P are the biomass densities of prey and predator, respectively, a and d are their per-capita rates of change in the absence of each other, and b and c are their respective rates of change due to interaction. This application of the principle of mass action seems to have been the point where predator-prey theory deviated from classical (logistic) thinking, and where subsequent theorizing may have been misled.
Shortly after publication of the Lotka-Volterra equations, Nicholson and Bailey (1935) proposed a discrete-time model of the interaction between insect parasitoids and their hosts. Although this model was developed from the more mechanistic perspective of parasitoid search behavior, it is identical in concept to the Lotka-Volterra model (Royama 1971).
The zero-growth isoclines of the Lotka-Volterra equations, obtained by setting their left-hand sides to zero, are perpendicular to the axis of the other species (Fig. la). Solutions of the differential equations (Eqs. 2) form a series of closed ellipses that depend critically on the initial conditions (neutrally stable limit cycles). In the more reasonable discrete-time (Nicholson-Bailey) form, however, the model has an unstable solution; i.e., the community equilibrium is an unstable focus (similar to the trajectory shown in Fig. la). A great deal of theoretical effort has gone into stabilizing the Nicholson-Bailey equations; i.e., by incorporating in-

dN/dt = aN(I - N/K) - bNP. (3a)
This modification produces an isocline structure similar to that shown in Fig. lb and stabilizes the system (the equilibrium is now a stable focus).
It is interesting that Volterra (1928, as translated in Chapman 1931) and Gause (1934) both used the logistic equation as the underlying structure for their twospecies competition models, but failed to consider it as a suitable framework for modeling predator-prey interactions. Leslie (1948) seems to have been the first to consider a logistic predator equation
dP/dt = cP(1 - eP/N), (3b)
where e is the density of prey required to maintain a single predator and to replace it with one offspring when it dies. In other words, e is the marginal subsistence demand for prey, I /e is the marginal reproductive value of the resource, and N/e is the carrying capacity of predators when provided with a constant supply of prey. Leslie's equation seems to be the first time that predator/prey ratios (P/N) rather than products (NP) are seen in models of trophic relationships. The system of predator-prey equations (Eqs. 3) has an isocline structure similar to that shown in Fig. 1 c, with the community equilibrium a stable focus. Notice that the predator isocline is slanting rather than vertical. This new isocline structure seems to be intuitively reasonable because predator equilibrium densities are expected to be dependent on prey abundance (see e.g., Berryman 1981, Arditi and Ginzburg 1989). In addition, the slanting predator isocline solves the paradoxes of enrichment and biological control (Arditi and Ginzburg 1989, Arditi and Berryman 1991).
PREDATOR FUNCTIONAL RESPONSES
The next major contribution to the theory of predator/prey interactions was the addition of a predator functional response. Solomon (1949) and Holling (1959, 1966) argued that, because predators can only handle a finite number of prey in a unit of time, the prey death rate should be a nonlinear function of prey density; i.e.,
dN/dt = aN(1 - N/K) - b(N)P, (4a)
where b(N) is the functional response of the predator to prey density. Based on a series of elegant behavioral

experiments, in which predators (sometimes blindfolded students) searched for different densities of prey (sometimes sandpaper disks), Holling derived his famous "disk" equation which turned out to be identical to the well-known Michaelis-Menten equation of enzyme kinetics (Real 1977); i.e.,

by DeAngelis et al. (1975). When inserted into classical predator-prey models, this ratio-dependent functional response produces a parabolic prey isocline and rightslanting predator isocline (Fig. 1 e), thereby solving the paradoxes of enrichment and biological control (Arditi and Ginzburg 1989, Arditi and Berryman 1991).

b(N) = mN/(w + N), (5)
where m is the maximum predator attack rate and w is the prey density where the attack rate is half-saturated. The Michaelis-Menten-Holling equation can be extended to account for general predators that switch from one prey species to another sigmoidd functional responses) (Real 1977). When the functional response is included in the prey equation, we obtain the parabolic (humped) prey isoclines (Rosenzweig 1971) that are characteristic of ratio-dependent prey equations (Fig. Id); note that the functional response introduces ratio-dependence into the prey equation because, when w is set to zero as in Fig. 1, the per-capita death rate of the prey becomes mP/N.
On the argument that the prey deaths can be directly translated into predator births, functional responses are often employed in predator equations; i.e.,
dP/dt = cP[mN/(w + N)] - dP. (4b)
However, this formulation gives rise to the primitive rectilinear Lotka-Volterra predator isocline from which arise the paradoxes of enrichment and biological control (cf. Fig. 1 a and d). Nevertheless, the isocline structure shown in Fig. Id has been employed extensively in the development of modem predator-prey theory (Rosenzweig and MacArthur 1963, MacArthur and Connell 1966).
RATIO-DEPENDENT FUNCTIONAL RESPONSES
Although the inclusion of a functional response in the predator-prey model is intuitively appealing, because it conservatively couples the prey and predator equations, there are some notable problems with this approach. For instance, the functional response describes the behavior of searching predators on a fast (behavioral) time scale (minutes or hours), whereas the population equation, into which it is inserted, often operates on a slower (population dynamical) time scale (days or years). To overcome this problem, Arditi and Ginzburg (1989) suggest that, in cases where the time scales are incongruent, the functional response should be expressed in terms of the ratio of prey to predators; e.g., the Holling Type II functional response should be written
b(N/P) = m(N/P)/(w + N/P) = mN/(wP + N). (6)
A similar feeding equation was proposed previously

THE PER-CAPITA VIEWPOINT
Berryman (1981) and Getz (1984) have argued that, because population dynamics arise from interactions between individual organisms, the equations should be derived as per-capita rates of change. For example, we could write the following general ratio-dependent percapita trophic equation,
dNI/Njdt = Ri = a, - f(NI/N,) - g,(N?+I/N,), (7)
where N, is the biomass density of the ith species in a trophic chain, R, is the per-capita rate of change of that species, a, is its maximum per-capita rate of change in a given physical environments defines the interaction between the species and the lower trophic level (its prey) as a function of the predator/prey ratio, and g, defines its interaction with the higher trophic level (its predator), also as a function of the predator/prey ratio. Using the type II functional response (Eq. 5) forf and g, we can obtain an explict per-capita trophic equation (see Appendix),
R, = a - bNj/(wjI + N_,) - cNj+1/(w, + N,), (8)
where bi defines the effect of intra-specific competition for food on the per-capita rate of change (f reduces to the classical logistic when w,_1 + N,-, = a constant; see Appendix), ci is a coefficient of vulnerability defining the effect of predation on the per-capita rate of change, and w, is the biomass density of all other food species in the ith trophic level. Notice that the per-capita viewpoint clarifies the ecological meaning of the functional response parameter wi, previously called the "half-saturation" point; i.e., it defines the quantity of alternative food available to the predator. Because the denominators of the predator/prey ratios in (Eq. 8) contain all the prey species available to each predator, while the predators utilizing that food are contained in the numerators, it is fairly straightforward to extend this equation to food webs with many species in each
trophic level. It is worth noting that, although simple per-capita
equations are nonlinear in respect to their variables, they are linear in their ratios and, therefore, can be fit to data with standard regression techniques (Berryman 1990). In this way, model parameters can be estimated a posteriori from time-series data, such as might be obtained from annual surveys or harvest records. For

APPENDIX

The type II functional response (Eq. 5) defines the attack rate per predator supplied with N prey, so for P predators the prey death rate is mNP/(w + N). Dividing by N gives the percapita death rate mP/(w + N) which, after relabelling, can be substituted forf and g, in Eq. 7 to give Eq. 8. It is important to note that the first per-capita functional response (f, in Eq. 7) reduces to the classical logistic when the lower trophic level is constant; e.g., a constant input of sunlight for plants. Under
this condition, w, l + N, I = a constant = E, l, and E Ilb= K, -, the equilibrium density or carrying capacity of the
environment. Leslie (1948) demonstrated this implicit functional response within the logistic equation; e.g., if we write the per-capita logistic predator equation (Eq. 3b)

dP/Pdt = c(l - eP/N),
Rp = c- bP/N, with b = ce. For a single predator foraging for prey in an arena, this be-
comes
RP = c - b/N,
which has an identical form to the type II functional response;
i.e., R, - -o as N -O and Rp- c as N -oo. Equivalency
between the logistic equation and the functional response occurs if the per-capita rate of change of the predator is assumed to be directly proportional to the number of prey eaten, a not unreasonable proposition.
