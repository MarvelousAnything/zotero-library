Biopower

‘Biopower’ is the term he uses to describe the new mechanisms and tactics of power focused on life (that is to say, individual bodies and populations), distinguishing such mechanisms from those that exert their influence within the legal and political sphere of sovereign power.

Biopower (Foucault)

G. Arnason, in Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics (Second Edition) , 2012
Biopower

Historically, biopower emerged with the transformation of power formations in Western societies starting in the seventeenth century, but the most drastic transformation took place during the nineteenth century. Gradually the sovereign’s right to take life or let live, symbolized by the sword, was transformed into society’s power to manage life, both by caring for the life of people and by limiting it, even to the point of terminating life. This transformation consisted of various techniques of power, of various ways of administering life. Foucault claims that this new power over life, that is biopower , evolved in two forms, which he called anatomo-politics of the human body and biopolitics of the population. They were distinct in the eighteenth century, but were eventually linked together through a multitude of relations and merged into a coherent, new technology of power in the nineteenth century.

The first form of biopower, the anatomo-politics of the human body, began to emerge in the seventeenth century with the rise of industrial societies, but its main development took place during the eighteenth century. As the anatomo-politics of the human body developed, it focused on the body as a machine and sought ways to discipline it, to make it both useful and docile, as it was integrated in the new economic system of industrialized societies. This is what ‘discipline’ means in Foucault’s Discipline and Punish . At first, the main institutional field of the anatomo-politics, or discipline, of the human body were the school and the army, but this aspect of biopower soon operated also in prisons, hospitals, and factories. Although these were the institutional fields discussed by Foucault, there were other fields as well.

Although the discipline of the human body reaches far beyond mere physical exercise, this can serve as an example, since unfit bodies tend to be less useful than fit ones. From the late nineteenth century, biopower is clearly manifested in sport and physical exercise in its various forms, both within institutions such as athletic youth organizations, athletic clubs, and gyms, and in less organized forms as sport movements or types of individual exercise. Even running, which appears on the surface to be a very simple, free, and noninstitutionalized form of exercise, is today a field of prolific knowledge production, power effects, and economic activities, focused on disciplining the body – not just the body of the competitive runner but every running body. This area of biopower includes scientific and medical experts; dissemination of scientific literature ranging from specialized science journals to popular magazines, websites, and blogs; techniques and equipment to monitor and measure certain physiological values such as pulse, maximum heart rate, the concentration of lactate in the blood, and the maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) (and all the knowledge about the meaning of such information and what to do with it); diagnosis, treatment, and therapies for running injuries; the development and circulation of training plans, information, and advice; websites that are a combination of a training diary, a social network, discussion forum, and an online store; a vast array of specialized shoes, clothing, and accessories; public events for everyone from the beginner to the ‘elite runner’; structures and strategies for recruiting beginners (running groups aimed at beginners, so-called C25k training plans promising to advance the novice from sitting on the couch to running 5 km without a pause, etc.); and support, motivation, and encouragement from many corporations, employers and the state. The runner is constantly told what to do, what to eat, what to drink, what to buy, and what that kind of a person is or is becoming.

Foucault’s analysis of power and discipline in Discipline and Punish , was an analysis of anatomo-politics of the body, but focusing of course on the penal system, on prisons and punishment. Already there he points to the wider use of the disciplinary techniques, for instance in schools, hospitals, military barracks, and so on. Foucault gives a particularly striking example of the transformation of the soldier from the early seventeenth century to the late eighteenth century. In the early seventeenth century, the soldier was a certain kind of person – not because of his training but because of his natural strength, courage, and grace. One could recognize soldier materials by such characteristics. In the late eighteenth century, on the other hand, the soldier was someone who had been formed through training and discipline; almost anyone could be made into a soldier thanks to the new techniques of disciplining the human body.

Similar fields of biopower have grown to surround patients, school children (and preschool children), as well as workers. Vast, complex networks of power and knowledge work to make their bodies useful and docile. This does not happen through any organized conspiracy of the government of industrialized societies, but it is rather the aggregate result of countless plans and strategies at various points throughout society during industrialization and up to this day.

The second form of power, the biopolitics of the population, emerged during the eighteenth century. It was concerned not with the human body but with the human species or human populations. Managing populations means managing reproduction, births and deaths, behavior, and health and sanitation. Biopolitics of the population consists in all sorts of techniques to intervene in and control populations. These interventions require the collection of enormous amounts of data about populations, analysis of the data and, finally, production of knowledge. This knowledge production led directly to the birth of demography and statistics in the eighteenth century.

The concept of biopower is relevant today for various topics in applied ethics, most obviously for topics related to the cases studied by Foucault: punishment and sexuality. The concept is also highly relevant for a great variety of other topics, for example reproduction, transformation of the body (from genetic and pharmacological enhancement to body-building, cosmetic surgery , and body art), public health, medical practice, biomedical sciences , race, and disability, to name just a few. The management of bodies and populations, and the sciences involved in that management, are so ubiquitous, that most topics in applied ethics may seem to invite an analysis of the mechanisms and micro-relations of power and knowledge. Still, it may not be clear to what extent such an analysis is relevant to ethics. That question in turn depends very much on our view of ethics. A power/knowledge analysis does not help us much if we are mostly interested in weighing risks, harms, and benefits. It is, on the other hand, extremely useful if we care about how we are managed and how we can resist the effects that that management has on us. We cannot escape power relations altogether, unless we leave society behind, but we can improve our standing in the power relations, defend ourselves against their effects, and open up new possibilities for action and being.

Medical Pluralism

Elisabeth Hsu, in International Encyclopedia of Public Health (Second Edition) , 2017
Deconstructing the Monolithic Medicine

Since the 1990s, Foucault's notion of biopower , the anthropology of the body and gender, the new reproductive technologies and kinship, and the politics of science and medicine, have gained momentum as themes for study within medical anthropology , while research on medical pluralism has been taken up with new fervor in other fields, such as public, international, or global health. Medical anthropology has certainly also seen a surge in critical studies of generally held medical assumptions. First, the notion of local biologies effectively did away with an early credo of some medical anthropologists that biomedicine ‘cures’ universally extant ‘diseases,’ and other forms of therapeutics ‘heal’ culturally constructed ‘illnesses.’ Thus, a life cycle phenomenon, like the loss of fertility in aging women, is not only experienced differently in Japan and North America but has also culture-specific biologies ( Lock, 1993 ). Or, rather than reducing medical practitioners to the humanitarian role of providing health services, their social agency and engagement in political movements has been described ( Adams, 1998 ). Differences in medicine and ways in which the body is conceived, or, rather, enacted, in different medical disciplines have led to an ethnographically based critique of the biomedical profession as a monolithic institution ( Mol, 2002 ). These studies did not set out to explore medical pluralism but are immensely important for current research on the theme because they have led to important redefinitions of what to some had been a unified state-supported hegemonic medicine with only one purpose. Medical anthropologists nowadays often speak of multiple medical realities.

Within the so-called risk society marked, in Ulrich Beck's view, by the dismantling of nation-states and by international interdependencies, the social position of medical professionals has also been shaken, their authority questioned, and their role as gate keepers in the domain of health delivery restricted. Instead, the multinational pharmaceutical and food industry , with ever more aggressive advertising, can reach their clientele directly, who in turn are driven by an ideology of individual responsibility for personal health and security. Biomedicine's unrivaled expansion and colonization of the southern and eastern worlds has been newly challenged. Flows of traditional medicines in ever more commercialized form are moving from the East into health markets of the West, and also of the South ( Hsu and Hoeg, 2002 ). In the light of the neoliberal commercialization of health care and the increased mobility of patients, health professionals and technologies, Höerbst and Wolf (2003 : p. 4) coined the term medicoscapes (derived from the work of Appadurai, 1990 ). They highlight that health personnel and health organizations have increasingly become interdependent through electronic communication, multinational pharmaceutical corporations, the WHO, and development agencies. Gone are the times where one could speak of a mosaic of clearly bounded, different medical cultures.

Medical pluralism implies there are many systems other than Western medicine. However, Western medicine does not exist as a monolithic discipline. The biomedical worlds are hugely diverse, fragmented, and fluid in themselves, changing in orientation, organization, research, and care delivery in a changing world.

Belief, Myth and Biopower

Bruno Salgues, in Health Industrialization , 2016
9.2.2 Biopower according to Foucault

According to Foucault, power is the sovereign’s right to rule. Biopower controls vital processes. It is a health approach suitable for a process of standardization: “biopower keeps us alive”. Therefore, Foucault falls in line with Lukacs [LUK 60] with his notion of class consciousness, although he wavers from one end of the spectrum to the other.

At first, Foucault focuses on the individuals that power – a disciplinary kind of power – tries to make obedient and productive. He creates an “anatomo-politics of the human body”. Thus, the body must be trained so that it can incorporate the norms of capitalist production. It is an individual-centric body discipline. Foucault’s disciplinary power was certainly an aspect of the history of telecommunications. Pagers allowed groups to order their militants to do certain things. However, the impact of this disciplinary power has remained weak. We could also mention ankle bracelets, namely, devices attached to someone’s body which use a mobile phone-like technology that allows us to find out the position of its wearer at any given time. At the other end of the spectrum, man belongs to a living species that has to be controlled biologically. This is how mass birth and health control and no-smoking campaigns are justified.

Foucault breaks away from traditional political order altogether. Judicial power was formerly in the hands of the monarch, who decreed what was allowed and what was prohibited. He also had the power to take someone’s life. Current legal norms allow us to exert control over life and define sane behavior, even if scientific progress proves the exact contrary. Therefore, it is in our best interest to remain healthy. Similarly, offenders become sick people and sanctions must be replaced with appropriate treatments.

Nicolas Poirier regards democracy as an explicit and permanent selfinstitution of society. Christian Ruby [RUB 07] claims that Nicolas Poirier offers a line of thought that “structures its coherence around a theory of the imaginary characterized by: constant attentiveness in relation to political issues, avoiding conceiving institutions as social things, etc.”. Institutions must ensure freedom and economic life (social control), and they must enable the ruler to increase his power.

Thus, Nicolas Poirier’s point of view is pessimistic. Monitoring our bodies fits into the attempt to widen the scope of power so that the individual himself can be brought under control. Biopower leads naturally to a totalitarian dimension, where these tools try to make power even more effective.

Bioenergy from plants and plant residues

Blake A. Simmons, in Plant Biotechnology and Agriculture , 2012
Introduction

The development of efficient routes of bioenergy production, defined here as the outputs of biofuels (liquid transportation fuels) and biopower (electrons produced by the consumption of biomass), that are scalable, cost-competitive, and sustainable, and can potentially displace a significant amount of petroleum and coal within the global energy sector has re-emerged as a topic of significant global interest, effort, and investment over the past decade. This renewed interest is attributed to two major drivers: (1) concerns over energy security and the reliance on finite fossil fuel supplies; and (2) the significant environmental risks associated with unabated carbon emissions of these fossil fuels . In 2009, the United States consumed 94.6 quads (one quad=10 15 BTU=1.055 exajoules [EJ]) of energy (see Figure 31.1 ), with the transportation and electricity sector accounting for 26.98 and 38.19 quads, respectively, with biomass contributing 3.88 quads. Globally, it is calculated that more than half of the current energy consumption of Earth is currently met by the consumption of liquid fossil fuels, and in 2009 over 20% of global carbon emissions were generated by the transportation sector alone ( Energy Information Administration, 2009 ).

Recent estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA) calculate that global demand for transport will increase by 45% by 2030, placing even further strains on a global fossil fuel production and distribution system that has reached its maximum in terms of production, and is a source of unmitigated carbon emissions. These constraints underscore the need for the realization and rapid commercialization of scalable and cost-effective means of generating low-carbon fuels and energy to meet the growing global demand in a sustainable and environmentally responsible fashion that promotes global energy security and environmental sustainability.

In light of these concerns, a significant number of governments worldwide are committed to displacing fossil fuels with renewable, low-carbon fuels produced from plant biomass grown on a sustainable basis. For example, the U.S. federal government has set a target of displacing 36 billion gallons of current U.S. petroleum consumption within the transportation sector by 2022 under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) legislation. With a production cap of 15 billion gallons per year placed on corn ethanol, this leaves a gap of 21 billion gallons of renewable liquid fuels per year that must be met by other sources and conversion technologies. Moreover, with total fossil fuel consumption within the transportation sector currently running at levels of ~200 billion gallons per year in the United States alone, the realization of advanced biofuels require the development of a significant commercial infrastructure capable of producing about this level of non-starch biofuels per year over a very short time frame. China, New Zealand, the European Union, United Kingdom, Brazil, Canada, and Australia are examples of others that have also established similar renewable bioenergy production targets, although most of the proposed deployment schedules have either been postponed or revised from the originally stated scale of production due to the global recession that started in 2008 .

There are numerous non-food biomass feedstocks that are considered appropriate, viable, and potentially sustainable for biofuel and biopower production worldwide. The current primary metrics used in determining their commercial viability are cost, energy density, and availability. These include oilseeds (e.g., rapeseed, soy, palm oil), agricultural residues (e.g., corn stover , wheat straw, rice straw, sugarcane bagasse), woody biomass (e.g., loblolly pine , eucalyptus, hybrid poplar), and dedicated energy crops (e.g., energy cane, sorghum, switchgrass , Miscanthus ). The selection of the most appropriate feedstock for a particular conversion technology is influenced by regional influences such as land availability, land ownership, rainfall, disposition of water rights, soil type, and use of fertilizers. A summary of the major current and future feedstocks by type and region is shown in Table 31.1 , and the projections for global biofuel production are presented in Figure 31.2 .

The assessments of the potential impact and deployment of bioenergy, and the land required to support it, vary widely. In one report, it was calculated that the available global agricultural energy is 25.9–33.5 EJ/year with the production of food crops accounting for 25.6 EJ/year, leaving little room for expanded biofuel production ( Johansson et al., 2010 ). This report found that the primary agricultural resources available for bioenergy production are residues and bioorganic waste, and that the conversion of these resources could replace one-fourth of current global fossil fuel consumption ( Johansson et al., 2010 ). In contrast, another report calculated that by 2050, the bioenergy potential available of land not needed for the production of feed and food could produce between 215–1272 EJ/year, with the majority of these resources located in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and South America ( Smeets et al., 2007 ). Some of the most critical (and controversial) issues around the sustainability and carbon benefits of increased bioenergy production are associated with how to measure and attribute direct and indirect land use change ( Miller et al., 2009; Cherubini and Ulgiati, 2009 ). All energy sources have direct and indirect effects that must be accounted for from a life cycle perspective, but to date most of the attention has been focused on the evaluation of biofuels alone ( Kim et al., 2009 ). Although this topic has sparked significant conversation and debate worldwide, there remains significant uncertainty in the modeling tools developed to date that can accurately assess and attribute these effects and, more important, be validated against known data sets ( Mullins et al., 2011 ).

As with all terrestrial systems of production, the ultimate potential for bioenergy depends to a great extent on the land available for production and the realization of sustainable methods of growing and harvesting this plant biomass resource responsibly. Currently, the amount of land devoted to growing energy crops for biomass fuels is calculated to represent only 0.19% of the world’s total land area and only 0.5–1.7% of the available agricultural land. Although there remains significant concerns around the sustainability of non-food feedstocks grown for biofuel and biopower production ( Cherubini and Stroemman, 2010 ), the “food vs. fuel” debate ( Knocke and Vogt, 2009 ), and other related issues such as centralized versus distributed modes of bioenergy production ( Serio et al., 2003 ), there is little doubt that plant biomass has a significant role to play in the renewable energy sector, especially in biopower and biofuel production if it is realized using rational, responsible, and reasonable development and deployment schedules ( Larson, 2006 ). This chapter breaks down the ongoing plant biomass activities into two main categories based on the type of conversion technology employed: (1) biochemical conversion; and (2) thermochemical conversion.

Microbial Resources for Global Sustainability

Jim Philp, Ronald Atlas, in Microbial Resources , 2017
Replacing fossil fuels with biofuels

Biomass represents an abundant carbon-neutral renewable resource for the production of bioenergy and biotechnological advances offer the potential for the development of sustainable biopower ( Ragauskas et al., 2006 ). Renewable biofuels are needed to displace petroleum-derived transport fuels, which contribute to global warming ( Chisti, 2008 ). Biodiesel and bioethanol are the two potential renewable fuels that have attracted the most attention. Ethanol yields 25% more energy than the energy invested in its production and biodiesel yields 93% more energy than the energy invested in its production ( Hill et al., 2006 ).

Estimates of the potential for bioenergy by 2050 range from 2 to 20 EJ/year or 17%–30% of projected total energy requirements ( Hall and House, 1995 ). In Brazil, 44% of the energy matrix is renewable and 13.5% is derived from sugarcane ( Soccol et al . , 2010 ). First-generation biofuels, with the exception of sugar cane ethanol, will likely have a limited role in the future transport fuel mix ( Chisti, 2008 ). Even dedicating all US corn and soybean production to bioethanol production would meet only 12% of gasoline demand and 6% of diesel demand ( Hill et al . , 2006 ). To achieve sustainable energy production, it will be necessary to replace easily fermentable sugars with lignocellulosic biomass that can be converted to ethanol ( Balat, 2011; Himmel et al . , 2007 ). By turning to lignocellulosic biomass it has been estimated that bioethanol production could replace 32% of the global gasoline consumption when bioethanol is used in E85 fuel for mid-size passenger vehicles ( Kim and Dale, 2004 ). Low-cost thermochemical pretreatment, highly effective cellulases and hemicellulases and efficient and robust fermentative microorganisms will make cost-effective bioethanol production from lignocellulose biomass possible ( Gray et al . , 2006 ).

Bokinsky et al. (2011) incorporated both biomass-degrading and biofuel-producing capabilities into a single organism (an Escherichia coli chassis organism) through metabolic engineering techniques. They engineered strains that express cellulase, xylanase, beta-glucosidase, and xylobiosidase enzymes under control of native E. coli promoters selected to optimize growth on model cellulosic and hemicellulosic substrates. One engineered strain carries out pinene synthesis, butanol synthesis, and fatty acid ethyl ester synthesis. These three metabolic pathways form the basis for fuel substitutes or precursors suitable for gasoline, diesel, and jet engines directly from ionic liquid-treated switchgrass . Although unproven at scale, this nevertheless demonstrates the economic potential of the techniques that come under the umbrella of synthetic biology. The authors stated that with improvements in both biofuel synthesis pathways and biomass digestion capabilities, this approach could provide an economical route to the production of advanced biofuels.

Besides providing renewable fuel resources to augment petroleum as a source of liquid fuels, biofuels can greatly reduce GHG emissions. Relative to the fossil fuels, GHG gas emissions are reduced 12% by using bioethanol and 41% by biodiesel ( Hill et al., 2006 ). As an example of what can be achieved, the addition of 25% ethanol to gasoline in Brazil reduced the import of 550 million barrels oil and also reduced the CO 2 emissions by 110 million tons ( Soccol et al . , 2010 ).

Hydrogen is also a potential biofuel that could greatly reduce GHG emissions. Japan has been especially interested in the biotechnological production of hydrogen to reduce GHG emissions for some time ( OECD, 1994 ). Current Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has dubbed hydrogen the “energy of the future,” and hopes it will help Tokyo meet the modest emissions targets it has set and hopes to be able to see hydrogen powered vehicles on Japanese roadways by 2020 ( http://phys.org/news/2015-11-japan-lofty-hydrogen-society-vision.html#jCp ). The Japanese efforts are coordinated across the academic and private sectors by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). Much of the effort is focused on engineering algae to photosynthetically produce hydrogen in sufficient quantities to enable industrial production of hydrogen as an automotive fuel. The basic advantages of biological hydrogen production from algae over other “green” energy sources are that it does not compete for agricultural land use, and it does not pollute, as water is the only by-product of the combustion. The microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is considered one of the most promising algal hydrogen producers and bioengineering is able to increase hydrogen production by suppressing oxygenic photosynthesis ( Dubin and Ghiradi, 2015; Esquível et al . , 2011; Kruse et al., 2005; Surzycki et al., 2007 ). This alga produces increased amounts of hydrogen when deprived of sulfur and the sulfur-deprivation process may eventually become commercially viable ( Torzillo et al., 2015 ). In the end it may be the cost of fuel cells compared to electric batteries in automobiles that limits the use of hydrogen rather than the ability to produce sufficient amounts of hydrogen through biotechnology.

Algae and cyanobacteria may also become an important source of sustainable biomass for biofuel production ( Chisti, 2008 ). Macroalgae-based biofuels present similar but slightly different opportunities and challenges from microalgae. Macroalgae are a readily accessible source of biomass, their culture and production methods are well developed, and the supply chain is well established. However, the physical footprint of macroalgae is larger than that of microalgae and, because it is more amenable to growth in the ocean, there are challenges in terms of containment and interaction with facilities, such as fisheries and wind farms. Challenges in terms of biofuel extraction and waste are being addressed. Bio Architecture Laboratories (BAL) ( http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2013/05/17/nlacm-leads-to-changing-times-at-bio-architecture-lab/ ) has recently engineered a microbe to degrade and a pathway to metabolize alginate, the most abundant sugar in seaweed ( Wargacki et al., 2012 ). Alginic acid/alginates constitute 20%–30% of the total dry matter content of brown seaweeds. The BAL platform can convert seaweed carbohydrates into a renewable chemical intermediate that is scalable and can be used to produce both fuels and a variety of chemicals for green plastics, surfactants, agrochemicals, synthetic fibers, and nutraceuticals.

One of the great problems with biodiesel production from algae is the extraction of the oil, which produces a lot of unwanted biomass that is difficult and expensive to dry. A direct process described by Robertson et al. (2011) combines an engineered cyanobacterial organism designed to produce and secrete an alkane diesel product continuously. The process is closed and uses industrial waste CO 2 at concentrations 50–100 times higher than atmospheric. The organism is further engineered to provide a switchable control between carbon partitioning for biomass or product.

Fatty acids composed of long alkyl chains and are akin to a natural “petroleum,” being primary metabolites used by cells for both chemical and energy storage functions. These energy-rich molecules are today isolated from plant and animal oils for a diverse set of products ranging from fuels to oleochemicals. A more scalable, controllable, and economic route to this important class of chemicals would be through the microbial conversion of renewable feedstocks, such as biomass-derived carbohydrates. Steen et al . (2010) demonstrated the engineering of E. coli to produce structurally tailored fatty esters (biodiesel), fatty alcohols, and waxes directly from simple sugars. Furthermore, they demonstrated the engineering of biodiesel-producing cells to express hemicellulases, a step toward producing these compounds directly from hemicellulose, a major component of plant-derived biomass. Combining this natural fatty acid synthetic ability of E. coli with new biochemical reactions that can be realized through synthetic biology has provided a means to divert fatty acid metabolism directly toward fuel and chemical products of interest.

Besides bioethanol and biodiesel bioaviation fuels are being produced from plant biomass through chemical processes. United Airlines, for example, is purchasing bio-aviation fuel from a California-based refinery that converts sustainable feedstocks, like nonedible natural oils and agricultural wastes, into low-carbon, renewable jet fuel. This biofuel is price-competitive with traditional, petroleum-based jet fuel, but achieves a 50% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions on a life cycle basis when compared to traditional jet fuel. United Airlines announced it plans to purchase up to 15 million gallons of sustainable aviation biofuel between 2015 and 2018 and to use a 30:70 blend ratio ( http://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/company/globalcitizenship/environment/alternative-fuels.aspx ).

Fertility: Political and Political–Economic Perspectives

S. Greenhalgh, in International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences , 2001
3 Foucauldian Perspectives on ‘Population’

Emerging in the mid- to late 1990s, a third stream of political research reflects the extraordinary influence of the French ‘poststructuralist’ philosopher and social critic, Michel Foucault, on the human sciences in general and anthropology in particular. Foucault's writing have left their mark on both of the above perspectives, but in the work discussed here his voice is more pervasive, shaping not only some of the terms of discourse, but the central problems addressed. Given limitations of space, this article covers only a few of his most provocative ideas on the interlacing of power and population.

In Discipline and Punish , History of Sexuality , and other works, Foucault ( 1978 , 1979 ) identified a new, modern form of power, biopower , which takes as its object life itself. Biopower operates by constituting its objects of knowledge, to which it then responds with the development of new knowledges, technologies, and arts of government. Far from being ‘neutral’ and power-free, the biological, medical, and social sciences are seen as parts of the apparatus of modern power. Through their scientific discourses, analytic categories, and intellectual practices, the natural and human sciences help to construct ‘fertility,’ ‘the body,’ ‘population,’ and ‘the social,’ in the process subjecting people to new, distinctly modern forms of power that affect how they constitute themselves as subjects. Given the sciences' close relationships with bureaucratic states in most settings, scientific knowledges of reproduction have often served the political objectives of regimes in promoting such goals as socioeconomic modernity, eugenic purity, and national power. In Foucault's view, modern power is embodied in discourses and practices that are not concentrated in any institution, such as the state or medical establishment, but widely dispersed throughout the social system. Yet hegemony is never complete, for ‘where there is power, there is resistance,’ leading to unstable configurations of power that are always open to contestation. Even this brief review of some Foucauldian concepts makes clear that Foucault's ideas unsettle the received terms of debates over reproduction. Among other things, they make language a central focus of analysis, redefine power, problematize the categories in which reproduction is understood, and turn the sciences, long thought to be beyond politics, into objects of political study in their own right.

Anthropologists and other students of reproduction have taken Foucault's broad, Eurocentric ideas, grounded them historically and culturally, and given the human subject of biopower more agency as a political actor. In the 1990s, two interrelated programs of research on reproduction have emerged, one focusing on the individual body, the other on the social body, or population as a whole. These are the two poles around which biopower is said to operate. Foucauldian work on the individual reproductive body focuses largely on the discourses and practices of biomedicine , which ‘medicalizes’ ever more phases of the female reproductive life cycle, turning what were once ‘normal’ aspects of procreation into ‘abnormal’ medical conditions, which it then proceeds to treat. Viewing the female body as a site of biomedical domination and resistance, researchers have explored the medicalization of pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause, and the accommodations and subversions of women for whom medical interventions are simultaneously seductive and dangerous. Key collections of anthropological work on such issues are Lock and Kaufert ( 1998 ), which examines the ‘microphysics of power’ and its operation in everyday life, and Davis-Floyd and Sargent ( 1997 ), which traces how authoritative knowledge about childbirth is produced, displayed, resisted, and challenged in different social, political, and clinical contexts.

While the anthropological research tends to work in the present and from the bottom up, focusing on the daily encounters between ordinary subjects and the agents of reproductive power, it exists in productive conversation with research in cultural studies of technoscience. The technoscience studies more often work historically and from the top down, tracing the development of the biological life sciences and their construction of the discourses, practices, and technologies over which contemporary reproductive contests are waged. Two exemplary studies of this sort are Oudshoorn's ( 1994 ) account of endocrinology and the hormonally constructed, sex-differentiated body, and Clarke's ( 1998 ) history of the scientific study of reproduction in biology, medicine, and agriculture, which resulted in the technoscientific production of modern means of contraception .

Foucauldian work on the population as a whole focuses on the role of demography, sociology , social work, social hygiene, urban planning, and other fields in constituting inappropriate (‘too high’ or ‘too low’) fertility as a ‘social problem.’ Working in and with state bureaucracies, these fields first identify fertility as an object of knowledge and management, and then foster the creation of new social technologies—the census, the social survey, the urban plan, the family planning program—designed to manage it at the level of the reproductive body, the home, the family, the city, and the nation-state. A relatively new research topic, the disciplinary and bureaucratic production of ‘population’ has so far yielded one major monograph , Horn's ( 1994 ) study of modernity and social reproduction in 1920s and 1930s Italy. Yet the Foucauldian notion of ‘population’ is an exciting and important construct that is certain to produce more such studies in the years ahead.

While these three political and political–economic perspectives grew out of different sets of intellectual and political concerns, by the late 1990s, as population had moved closer to the center of social theory, the lines between them, always thinly drawn, had begun to fade and disappear. This blurring of boundaries can be expected to continue into the future, giving rise to a broad politics of reproduction and population that is multilevel in scope, multidisciplinary in approach, and politically engaged in the policy implications of the research.

Biomass Resource Assessment☆

M.E. Walsh, in Reference Module in Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences , 2014
Biomass Resources Assessments

Biomass resources can be used for energy purposes such as steam, heat, and/or electricity or to produce liquid and gaseous transportation fuels (e.g., ethanol, biodiesel , hydrocarbons similar to gasoline and diesel). They can also be used to produce new composite fiber materials and numerous bioproducts currently produced from fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) such as organic chemicals, lubricants , adhesives, lacquers and varnishes, and printing inks among others.

The diversity of biomass resources , the flexibility to produce numerous biobased products, and the potential to address economic, environmental, energy, and climate issues has lead to increased efforts to evaluate their availability.

Biomass resource assessments are conducted for many different purposes such as to determine if sufficient quantities of reasonably priced materials are available to supply a biopower or biofuels facility; to assess the potential to develop a regional bioindustry to aid in economic development and employment objectives; and to evaluate the potential for bioenergy to address energy, environmental, and climate change issues among others.

Biomass resource assessments are diverse. They can focus on a single resource or examine multiple resources. Assessments can be spatially diverse and estimate local, regional, national, or global supplies. They can be made for a single point in time (e.g., what's currently available) or include projections of future availability. Assessments can estimate the theoretical quantities (i.e., maximum physical quantities), technical quantities (quantities available subject to physical/technical limitations), or economic quantities (price considerations included). Factors that affect the quantities and prices of biomass resources and that are accounted for to a lesser or greater degree in assessments include physical limitations (e.g., soil and water limitations for energy crops; access to forests in remote areas), technical limitations (e.g., efficiency of harvest machinery to collect the resource; energy crop yields), environmental limitations (e.g., quantities of agricultural residues needed to control soil erosion and soil carbon for long term productivity; wildlife diversity needs), economic considerations (e.g., competition for land between energy crops and traditional crops used for food and feed; alternative uses for biomass resources), policy considerations (e.g., crop subsidies; renewable portfolio standards; emission regulations; carbon taxes), and social factors (e.g., ethical values; aesthetic values; not-in-my-back-yard).

The Necessary Industrialization of Medicine

Bruno Salgues, in Health Industrialization , 2016
2.3.4 Economic meaning of apparatus

Agamben wishes to include a fourth meaning of the term, the so-called “economic” one. He reminds us that the word “oikonomia” means household (Oikos) administration, or more generally management [AGA 07, p. 20]. According to him, “what is common to all these terms is that they refer back to this oikonomia , that is, to a set of practices, bodies of knowledge, measures, and institutions that aim to manage, govern, control, orient – in a way that purports to be useful – the behaviors, gestures, and thoughts of human beings” [AGA 07, p. 28]. Thus different options appear. First of all, let us focus on the concept of “ biopower ”, i.e. on how the power of the apparatus acts upon humans and other members of the “bio” world. The other notion derives from the definition of the new offers in terms of treatment sites. The current vocabulary concerning this topic is willingly ambiguous, as is proved by the term “home care”.

Agamben comes to the following definition: “I shall call an apparatus anything that has in some way the capacity to capture, orient, determine, intercept, model, control or secure the gestures, behaviors, opinions or discourses of living beings” [AGA 07, p. 31]. He draws the conclusion that there are only two categories: apparatuses and living beings. Between these two, he places the subject. According to him, the subject is the result of the relation and, so to speak, of the hand-to-hand fight between living beings and apparatuses. He adds an incomplete conclusion: “It would probably not be wrong to define the extreme phase of capitalist development in which we live as a massive accumulation and proliferation of apparatuses” [AGA 07, p. 33]. As a result, apparatuses could not be a mere accident men are caught in by chance. They have deep roots in the process of “humanization” and in the development of capitalism. These apparatuses carry out what men, on the other hand, would not be able to do in such circumstances. This is why we need to leave behind the concept of a tool as defined by anthropologists and why the notion of apparatus starts making sense. Thus, robots perform surgery better than men, since the surgeon’s shaky hand holding a tool does not come into play.

Agamben mentions the split introduced by the “oikonomia”, namely the division between being and action. This scission separates the living being from himself as well as from his relationships with his setting and environment. According to Agamben, this represents “what Uexküll and then Heidegger name the circle of receptors-disinhibitors. The break or interruption of this relationship produces boredom in living beings – that is, the capacity to suspend this immediate relationship with their disinhibitors” [AGA 07, p. 36]. We will have to investigate the importance of this division.

Mondialisation, the Maker of Biopower

Bruno Salgues, in Health Industrialization , 2016
8.1 Mondialisation versus globalization (definition)

According to Marc Augé, “The word Mondialisation refers to two kinds of realities: on the one hand, what we call globalization, which corresponds to a worldwide extension of the so-called liberal market and of ICT networks, and on the other what we may define as planetary conscience or planeterization, which in turn is composed of two elements”.
8.1.1 Two kinds of conscience

The topic we are discussing here, i.e. health, is deeply involved in these technological networks, and it is even their most tangible depiction.

In relation to the first meaning given, the diffusion of medical technologies around the globe relies on the same principle.

In this case, planetary conscience is a two-fold notion. The first connotation may be qualified as ecological:

    “Every day we are aware of living on the same fragile and threatened planet, infinitely small in an infinitely large universe”.

This ecological conscience barely affects the health industry, apart maybe from its indirect effect on pollution-related diseases.

The second form of conscience is social:

    “We are also aware of the ever-growing gap between the richest and the poorest, and of the parallel gap between knowledge and ignorance”.

What should we think of this planetary ecological or social awareness that is never put into action? In the health industry, this gap is inexorably becoming wider.

As a result:

    “The term ‘globalization’ refers to the existence of a global liberal market – or deemed such – and of a worldwide technological network, to which, however, a large number of people have no access yet. The global world is then a network-centric world, a system defined by spatial and also economic, technological and political parameters” [AUG 08, p. 41].

We will add psychological parameters to this list. The ancestral fear of those diseases that make the body decay from the inside because of external pathogens has two consequences: the psychology of disgust as felt for these pathogens leads to overdiagnosing, overdosing and overtreating.
8.1.2 Alienation

It would be easy to claim that the need for connection leads to a contemporary form of alienation, which is the mark of this new society. On the other hand, we will use several concepts that derive from these debates, which account for the following elements:

–

    The first consequence is that alienation becomes meaningless whenever a control-centric kind of culture makes us agree to be under the heel of a “Big Brother” or “ Biopower ”.This is a theme that we have accepted together with Ronell.
–

    The second is that alienation becomes meaningless whenever permanent connection is indispensable and inexorable, which is the case for the technological systems that we can access on our mobiles, like social networks.

8.1.3 Alienation according to Marxists

We cannot ignore the concept of alienation without justifying its rejection. One of the first causes of this rejection is twofold. Often alienation is a sort of bar-room-politics concept. However, this notion of alienation as put forward by authors such as Marx or Hegel was re-formulated from their juvenilia all the way to their crucial works, without any sort of detectable stability in the matter.

The second reason for this rejection lies in the alienation/work association. As François Perroux recalls: “K. Marx, Hegel’s heir, fights against his legacy. He removes the concept of first alienation from the political domain and that of disalienation from the world of ideas. He finds the first and fundamental form of alienation in the economic dimension. It derives from the relationship between capital and labor” [PER 70, p. 8]. It is therefore clear that the capital/labor relationship is quite different from interpersonal associations or the connections created between an individual and a machine by means of a mobile that links them together. Nonetheless, our views throughout the text will be informed by Marxism. According to Perroux, “Marx’s terminology itself hints at different kinds of alienation. Production becomes alien to man. Labor and its driving force turn into objects. Social relationships become reified and objectified”. This last point will become the focus of our analysis and justifies our ontological and axiological approach. How are mobile phones, as objects, reified? How does the concrete telephone relationship between two people become a “thing” that can be analyzed as such? The literature on this topic will show us that this reification can be carried out in different ways: for example, through images according to McLuhan and through voice according to Ferraris 1 .

The basic form of Marxist alienation can be found within infrastructures, but there is a secondary form of alienation located within superstructures. Consequently, complete disalienation would require the destruction of both these types of alienation.
8.1.4 What role does alienation play?

In the previous sections, we rejected the notion that the alienation deriving from addiction is specific to a technology, such as video games, or constitutes one of its features. On the other hand, the notion of boredom leads us back to this topic.

Boredom always involves the awareness of being trapped in a given situation or, quite simply, globality. We could qualify this imprisonment as alienation. Alienation cannot be an ideal, as that would raise the question of knowing what men are alienated from. It requires us to spell out another element: the alienating object, namely, the element that has been lost. The cause of alienation does not lie in mobile phones or video games, but rather in the situation we find ourselves in.

According to Bertrand Vergely, alienation is characteristic of a condition of self-estrangement. This situation allows us to understand the human condition that consists of no longer being what we are without having lost our being [VER 03, p. 76].

According to Svendsen, boredom has a dehumanizing effect, which is a type of alienation. It deprives human life of the meaning that actually makes it what it is [SVE 03, p. 284]. Our existence is constituted by our being-in-the-world or, in other terms, a polarity between subject and object, men and what surrounds them. Svendsen also claims that, when bored, we feel “the inexistence of reality or the reality of inexistence”.

These two authors lead us to wonder about the alienating role played by the aforementioned situations in the health industry. Certain members of the medical profession confine this alienation to the mere constraint represented by the regular intake of medication.
8.1.5 François Perroux’s critique

In his work, François Perroux [PER 70] introduces the term objectification to contest this approach which reduces reality to objects. In the unindustrial system of medicine, which is going to disappear, objectification is a key notion. This process lies beneath the concept of evidence-based medicine (EBM) or biomarkers.

    “Some systematic reflections mistake objectification for alienation. Every objectification of the subject is regarded as a reification and concretization which, as a consequence, alienates him. Now, every subsistent, existing, and coherent subject consists of objectification; if every objectification were a kind of reification, every discernible subject would vanish and the fact of analyzing it would throw us into the dimensions of things” [PER 70, p. 19].

François Perroux claims that “in every direction, the individual is desubjectified by a system of institutions (game-rule institutions and body institution). The irreducibility of self-knowledge and the originality of one’s spontaneity can only be grasped in relation to networks of social specification and determination” [PER 70, p. 22]. Clinical trials sounded the knell for individual medicine. Faced with the arrogance of some mandarins in the know, clinical trials are becoming one of the mainstays of budding industrialization.

This quotation leads us to the core of our approach. Perroux himself provides us, in the following pages, with some method guidelines:

    “At any given moment, each subject is objectified and socialized: 1) by his social horizon, i.e. the number of variables he takes into account to set up his existential plan or abandon a given plan of action; 2) by the scope of his possibilities, namely the number of alternative situations that he compares to his previous situation by deeming them achievable; 3) by his sphere of action or influence, namely the number and kind of variables that he modifies by performing conscious and deliberate actions. From time to time, these three spheres happen to be interrelated” [PER 70, p. 24].

Due to this fact, new choices become available. No doctor knows what is best for a given individual, but he knows the result of clinical trials carried out on groups of symptoms (at least theoretically). Moreover, no theory will be able to verify a clinical result for the whole of the population, since each individual is different.

This point of view seems too mechanical to us even in relation to cybernetics, even if later on we will be led to analyze the scope of possibilities. Randomized clinical trials are carried out in order to eliminate all kinds of subjective factors and even the subjectivity of the patient itself, which is often called placebo effect.
8.1.6 The recent rejection of alienation-improvement duality in the health industry

Every journal belonging to the literature of the early 1980s is characterized by the multiplicity of texts that it proposes in relation to this field. These documents constitute a critical response to the myth of technological progress. The most recent type of this debate consists of the search for a point of reference between alienation and the well-being created by its objects. A recent form of rejection of this kind of debate can be found in authors like Caron and Caronia who, from the very introduction of their work, announce that: “As communication instruments become part of our daily routine, they free us from most of the spatial and temporal constraints that govern our lives. Significantly, overcoming such constraints has ramifications beyond the ability to effectively manage the multiple, simultaneous tasks that characterize contemporary life” [CAR 05, introduction, p. 6]. A few years before, François Perroux was already mentioning this debate: “What is worse, devices seem to make use of men. The alienated man keeps describing his anxiety in revelatory terms: he defines himself as a cog of a large machine, he is caught in a mesh, he is crushed by the machine (a hellish machine in which ignorance and fate work against men, as was the case in Jean Cocteau’s famous work); he is laminated like metal, snatched like a drive belt, crushed by a weight like in an elevator crash” [PER 70, p. 32]. Clinical trials are based on the principle of biostatistics in order to eliminate any kind of alienation limited to a few individuals. The best choice for a person consists of a group choice. Thus, we get to the analogy between labor and the car industry assembly line. The principle of EBM, a statistical form of medicine, is “let us automatically treat all those patients with the same data”, which constitutes the basis for a creeping and hidden form of industrialization. EBM is paradoxical in that it attempts to treat patients when they actually aspire to a customized kind of medicine. This demand is even more accentuated by our santacteur .

This debate is recently being revived, even if no longer in terms of alienation versus improvement. It has more to do with the impact of these technologies on spatial and temporal constraints, and with the role played by these tools in present-day life.

As for the first point, Caron and Caronia affirm a few lines further on that: “These are examples of the many ways that emerging communication technologies impart meaning to daily life. Once they become integrated into our routines, they reformulate possible meanings: places, actors, reciprocal relations, and the typical events that comprise them are thus amenable to new modes of accomplishment and interpretations” [CAR 05, p. 7].

At first, this creates a research approach: places, actors, their reciprocal relations and typical events. In a second phase, it brings back into focus certain authors that had become obsolete, such as Maslow and his levels of achievement.

The subject and power of bioethics

G. Hull, UNC Charlotte , in Ethics, Medicine and Public Health , 2017
Bless me Fitbit, for I have sinned…

According to Foucault, biopower traces its roots back to pastoral power – the power of a minister over his flock – under medieval Christianity. As he puts it, pastoral power “gave rise to an art of conducting, directing, leading, guiding, taking in hand, and manipulating men, an art of monitoring them and urging them on step by step, an art with the function of taking charge of men collectively and individually throughout their life and every moment of their existence” [48 p.165] . The pastorate does not disappear with the rise of modern power forms, as he emphasizes more than once [48 p.148, 50] 17 . Indeed, he makes a much stronger claim: “I think this is where we should look for the origin, the point of formation, of crystallization, the embryonic point of the governmentality whose entry into politics … marks the threshold of the modern state” [48 p.165] .

One of the pastor's responsibilities is surveillant, because to guide the flock, you must know the flock: “the pastor must really take charge of and observe daily life in order to form a never-ending knowledge of the behavior and conduct of the flock he supervises” [48 p.181] . The acquisition of knowledge about subjects is fundamental to the operation of disciplinary power, as Foucault formulates it in Discipline and punish . So too, the specific sense in which pastoral power carries with it the logic of its own extension is very similar to what he calls the “swarming of the disciplines” in Discipline and punish , where disciplinary institutions extend their data-collecting reach (by talking to the neighbors of truant children, for example, about the prayer habits of the children's parents), as well as through the dissemination of the procedures themselves [50 p.211] .

One of the central ways this epistemic function happens is to get the individual members of the flock to produce (and desire to produce) their own truth about themselves. That is, after all, both efficient and probably more efficacious than earlier techniques. Again, in the terms of Discipline and punish , the key to the efficiency of disciplinary power is that one never has to actually exercise it: through a process of careful behavioral conditioning, subjects take compliance with regulatory demands upon themselves.

One of the main vehicles for such truth production is the confession, which is a central theme of History of sexuality I . In that text, Foucault proposes that confession is, “since the Middle Ages, at least … one of the main rituals we rely on for the production of truth” [10 p.58] . As he notes:

    One confesses in public and in private, to one's parents, one's educators, one's doctor, to those one loves; one admits to oneself, in pleasure and in pain, things it would be impossible to tell anyone else, the things people write books about. One confesses – or is forced to confess [10 p.59] .

Or, as he puts it in a later lecture course, “the obligation to tell the truth about oneself has never ceased in Christian culture, and probably in Western societies.” He adds that “putting oneself in discourse is … one of the major driving forces in the organization of subjectivity and truth relationships in the Christian West” [51 p.311] . That is, “we are obliged to produce the truth by the power that demands truth and needs it to function” [52 p.24] .

By way of example, consider the intersection between wearable technologies and employee wellness programs in the U.S. Many employers offer some sort of financial incentive to those who are willing to confess their daily habits to the insurance company (or the employer) 18 . Employees should have a primary care physician; swear that they don’t smoke; and upload some biometric data (like blood pressure, blood sugar count, weight, BMI, etc.) into insurance databases. Employees who fail to comply can be faced with punitively higher premiums, or even the denial of coverage altogether [54] . The technique produces and teaches a direct tie between salvation in the form of lower insurance premiums and the confession of one's health habits. As Foucault notes with regard to disciplinary power, the technique is portable and applicable to other contexts. For example, car insurance companies offer lower premiums to drivers willing to have their driving monitored; as Scott Peppet [55] notes, the adoption of this monitoring technology by the best drivers (who have a strong financial incentive to participate) generates an inexorable logic for others to adopt the technology so as to associate with the in-group. Eventually, not consenting to confessing one's driving habits becomes itself the justification for suspicion and higher premiums.

As we know, financial incentives to do things that many people do not like or do not have the time to do (such as exercise) generate all kinds of other incentives – like lying about whether one smokes or exercises. Indeed, people do not seem to be particularly compliant and experience these little exercises in data entry as annoying, intrusive and paternalistic. So, as Bruno Latour [56] observed a long time ago, we outsource a lot of our moral enforcement to devices like automatic door closers and automatic seat belts . Here is where wearable technology intervenes, as a way to compel confession 19 . Imagine a wellness plan that requires employees to wear fitbits or other electronic monitoring devices. The granularity of such surveillance is already high and certain to increase in the future, as insurance companies learn to mine their data (or purchase it cheaply from others) for risk factors and predictors of poor outcomes. Some of this data will not be data users voluntarily provided (or thought they were providing), as data brokers will learn how to associate either seemingly unrelated data (furniture purchasing habits and diabetes risk: do you tend to comfy sofas?) or metadata (do you spend a lot of time on the phone with other couch potatoes? How about playing multiplayer video games?).

In doing all this, the intersection of wellness programs and wearable technologies would represent an intensification of the logic of confession, applied to the intersection of health and work. Most generally, the programs represent the nexus of the emergence of “lifestyle medicine” and the consequent medicalization of everyday life since the 1970s [58] and the emergence of steadily more granular and intensive workplace surveillance [59] . This combination aims at nothing less than a reinterpretation of our traditional concept of the employment-health relation. As David McGillivray puts it, “under health promotion logic, workplaces are now recognized as places that can be ‘good’ for, rather than deleterious to, your health and well-being” [60 p.130] . Put differently, the emphasis on “fitness” is an entirely different way of looking at health: bodies are not at danger from outside, aleatory events, but in a process of continual adjustment to (and preparation for) risks brought about by their own behaviors. “Fitness” becomes a proxy for health because it becomes a marker of adequate risk preparedness [7] 20 .

All of this is not to say such programs as these are actually good; after all, living under a regime of constant surveillance might make one feel less attached to work, and more stressed while there. As Hansen notes:

    In this attention to personal problems–as the source of potential costs to productivity – workplace monitoring practices and other ‘stress-inducing’ workplace practices are effectively excluded from serious consideration as a credible source of unease, discontent and associated grounds to inefficiency [65 p.163] .

Hansen concludes that the current programs represent a “transition … from a form of governance characterized by a pastoral mode of control and care to a neoliberal form of discipline, marked by an increasing reliance on the motivation of workers towards self-management, self-monitoring and self-correction” [65 p.160] . Or, as McGillivray put it, “this health promotional logic appears to provide medicalized legitimacy for the organizational governance of an employee's subjectivity” [60 p.132] .
