 a war begins, is it not the children of ordinary people who serve as 
cannon fodder?” said a post signed Da Ke Ming Yi on the Weibo social 
media platform. “Those who died were the children of ordinary people.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">A
 letter signed by five professors from prominent universities that 
criticized Russia for attacking a weaker neighbor appeared briefly on 
social media before being deleted.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“We
 stand against unjust wars,” said the academics from schools including 
Tsinghua University in Beijing, alma mater of many ruling party leaders.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Comments
 posted by nationalists criticized the professors for failing to stick 
to the ruling party’s official position of neutrality.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 ruling party has spent decades using school textbooks and the entirely 
state-controlled media to nurture a sense of nationalist grievance. It 
accuses the United States of trying to block China’s rise to its 
rightful position of global leadership.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-75"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-33">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-36"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-34"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle2" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-32"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">State
 media repeat Beijing’s position that the United States and its European
 allies are to blame for the Ukraine war because they failed to respond 
to Russian concerns that its democratic neighbor should be barred from 
joining NATO, the Western military alliance.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">That
 echoes Chinese complaints that Washington and its allies are 
interfering in its domestic affairs and issues of national sovereignty, 
including its claim over Taiwan, territorial disputes in the South China
 Sea, and in Xinjiang, the far-western region where China has been 
accused of detaining over a million Uyghurs.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Russia’s
 attack, as a historical event, “is not a good one,” but “people think 
the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is because the United States 
stirred up trouble,” said Zheng Bowen, a 38-year-old engineer.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 state-run newspaper Capital News exhorted the public to line up with 
the ruling party: “The nation’s attitude is our attitude.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“China
 has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude, calling on all 
parties to exercise restraint and ease the situation, and return to 
dialogue and negotiation,” it said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">However,
 the newspaper appeared to support Putin’s demand that Ukraine become a 
neutral buffer between Russia and Europe and give up the possibility of 
NATO membership.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“Ultimately,
 Ukraine should be a bridge between East and West, rather than a 
frontier of confrontation between major powers,” the Capital News said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Comments online have called for China to support Russia by purchasing its exports of oil, gas and other goods.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“Let
 the Russian Embassy sell their goods on livestream. Let’s show them 
China’s buying power,” said a comment signed Bao Zou Guang Xiao Pang on 
Weibo. It received 42,000 likes.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">A
 separate comment advocating that China maintain normal trade with 
Russia, an implicit rejection of sanctions, received nearly 80,000 
likes.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Social 
media platforms have urged users to act responsibly and say they have 
removed thousands of postings about the attack on Ukraine.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Douyin,
 a short-video service operated by the Chinese owner of TikTok, said it 
deleted more than 3,500 videos and 12,100 comments due to “vulgar, war 
belittling, sensationalist and unfriendly comments.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The popular WeChat message service also complained about “vulgar posts” that it said have a “negative impact on cyberspace.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">It
 said some users “took the opportunity to publish bad information about 
international current affairs,” including comments belittling the war 
such as crass jokes about “gaining course credits by going to Ukraine 
and fighting in the war” and asking “Ukrainian beauties to come to 
China,” the platform said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">WeChat’s post was later shared by a unit of China’s internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Weibo said it removed more than 4,000 posts that were vulgar and ridiculed war. It said more than 10,000 accounts were closed.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“Peaceful
 environments do not come easily,” the company said in a social media 
post. It called on users to “maintain an objective and rational 
attitude” and take part in discussion “in a reasonable manner.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">AP video producer Olivia Zhang in Beijing contributed to this report.</p></div></div></div><div class="Component-footer-0-2-1 -footer"><div class="fluid-wrapper"><div class="Component-grid-0-2-2"><nav class="Component-nav-0-2-3"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">AP NEWS</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-news">Top Stories</a></li><li><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/videos">Video</a></li><li><a href="mailto:support@apnews.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="https://apnews.com/accessibility-statement">Accessibility Statement</a></li><li><button class="optanon-show-settings">Cookie Settings</button></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-apps-0-2-4"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Download AP NEWS</div><div class="Component-downloadDescription-0-2-11">Connect with the definitive source for global and local news</div><div class="Component-list-0-2-13"></div></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-moreFromAp-0-2-5"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">More from AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/">ap.org</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://insights.ap.org/">AP Insights</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.ap.org/">AP Definitive Source Blog</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://apimagesblog.com/">AP Images Spotlight</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/explore/">AP Explore</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/books/">AP Books</a></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-followAp-0-2-6"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Follow AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-17"><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/AP" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-twitter"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/APNews" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-facebook"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AssociatedPress" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-youtube"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/associated-press" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-linkedin"></use></svg></a></li></ol></nav><div class="Component-divider-0-2-7 Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><div class="Component-legalStuff-0-2-8 Component-legalStuff-0-2-20"><nav class="Component-legalStuffNav-0-2-21"><div class="Component-title-0-2-24 Component-spaceBelow-0-2-27">The Associated Press</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-22"><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/about/">About</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/contact-us/">Contact</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://aphelp.ap.org/">Customer Support</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/careers/">Careers</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a href="https://apnews.com/termsofservice">Terms &amp;

She was shot in the hand when their car was raked with gunfire from a roadside forest, said her mother, who identified herself only as Nina.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The girl’s father, who drove frantically from the ambush on blown-out tires, underwent surgery. His wife said he had been shot in the head and had two fingers blown off.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Western officials said Russian forces have made little progress on the ground in recent days and are seeing heavier losses and stronger Ukrainian resistance than Moscow apparently anticipated.

Victory in the Club World Cup last month completed the set of major honors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The success has been funded by around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) of loans to the club that Abramovich said he didn't want repaid when putting the club up for sale last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHY SANCTION ABRAMOVICH?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich has used legal means to try to publicly distance himself from benefiting from an association with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The British government thinks otherwise, saying Abramovich has obtained “a financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the government of Russia,\" including tax breaks, the sale of shares at favorable rates, and contracts in the buildup to Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich “is or has been involved in destabilizing Ukraine” via Evraz, a steel manufacturing and mining company which he effectively controls and has potentially supplied the Russia military, the government said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His fortune was made in oil and aluminium following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2005, Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom paid $13 billion for the Sibneft oil company controlled by Abramovich. It allowed Putin’s Kremlin to recapture state influence in the lucrative energy industry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON CHELSEA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The sanctions could have immediately forced Chelsea to stop running as a business, and preventing its teams from completing their seasons.
