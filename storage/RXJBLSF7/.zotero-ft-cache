The purpose ofthis reportisto describethewoodybiomassresourcewithin U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest and Alaska Regional Biomass P='ogram,comprised of southeast Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. In additionto the regional forest biomass assessment, information will be presented for logging residue, which represents current energy conversion opportunities.

The information presented in the report is based on data and relationships already published. Regionally applicable biomass equations are generally not available for species occurring in the west.Because of this,a number of assumptions were made to develop whole-tree biomass tdbles. These assumptions are required to link algorithms f"om biomass studies to regional timber inventory data published by the Forest Inventoryand Analysis Research Units (FIA), of the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain Research Stations, U.S. Forest Service. These sources and assumptions will be identified later in this report. Tabular biomass data will be presented for 11 resource areas, identified in the FS inventory publications. These areas are shown below:

Total tree biomass as defined in the report refers to the above ground weight of a tree above a 1.0 foot stump, and exclusive of foliage. A glossary is included that defines specific terms as used in the report. Inventory terminology is derived from forest inventory reports from Forest Inventory and Analysis units at the Intermountain and Pacific Northwest Research Stations.
Significant highlights and relationships of the regional resource will be shown in a series of graphs and charts.

_1_, ,,

The five western States representing the Pacific Northwest and Alaska Regional Biomass Program of the U.S. Department of Energy, cover about 256 million acres of land and contain approximately one-third of the Nation's timber resource (U.S. Department of Agriculture 1981b). This vast resource is concentrated on approximately 30 percent of the total area, referred to as timberland; land supporting timber that is generally considered to be available for continuing production of woody fiber (see figure 2 for general forest zones). This resource supports a largeforest products industry, accounting for a significant shareof the wood products consumed ir United States. This resource also represents a source of supply for a potentially significant wood using ipdustry----energy. Energy production based on woody biomass1grew considerably following the fuel shortages of the mid-seventies. This growth occurred primarily within the forest products industry and residential sectors of the economy. New legislation, advancing technology, and the renewabSenature of wood provide the basis for greater relianceon biomass as a contributor to the region's energy needs in the future.

Introduction
"

Figure2: Generalizedforestzoneswithin5-Statearea
' See Glossary for terms used in this report.

The current surplus of energy in the region, while dwindling, has temporarily slowedthe rateof growthof consumptionof woodfor energy. An examination of thewood energysituationin California,however,givesa good indicationof changesthat mightbe expected in the near future in thisfive-State region.
Based on different economicand energysupply and demand relationships,the use of woody biomassfor energy in California hasexpanded rapidly in the last five years. Information from energy producers in that State indicate that total demand for wood by ali existing and planned facilities equals almost 10'million tons annually. This expansion has resulted in some energy producers looking to other areasfor potential sources of wood supply. Where and how thisgrowth in the use of wood for energy will occur is an important question. A better understanding ofthe region's vast timber resource is a prerequisite for addressing this question. Adequate information exists to evaluate the suppiy needed by conventional wood product industries. What is needed, however, is more information on the entire woody biomass resource. This report brings together the best data available on the woody biomass resource of the 5-State area, as input to energy and other wood products industries and decisionmakers consideringthe above question. This report does notadd to the depth and precision of biomass data,a majorissue faced by aliwoody biomass users and managers in the West. This need must be met before the region's biomass resource can be effectively managed.
The pdma_/purpose of this report is to identify significantsourcesof woody biomassthatmayhave potentialforsupplyingcurrentorfutureenergyconversionfacilities.No attemptis madeto defineamountsthat mightbe availableto a specificlocation.This is a large task, needinginformationon a complexset of criteria that affect the r)hysicaland economicfeasibilityof using woody biomassfor energy. Because of this complexity,and additionalconstraints related to forest management objectives,estimates of the total amount of biomass that might be available on an annual basis were not made. An exceptionto this are the loggingresidue data, which are based on annual harvestlevels.

Area figures were taken directly from the FIA inventory reports noted above. Total land area represents ali land within the State boundaries, except bodies of water so designated by the Bureau of Census. Timber"landis that area considered to be suitable for producing continuing crops of trees, and not withdrawn from timber production for various reasons. Trees do occur on other lands, but are not considered for future timber production because of statute, low productivity, or other special use designations.

Inventory volumes (cubicfeet) were accumulated for each State or resource area from the latest FIA report. These volumes were then converted to weight using average weight values. These average values were computed by taking wood density information by species, weighted by the proportion of total inventory volume by that species. This information is displayed in the appendix of this report, for green and dry weights. Following calculation of inventory weight, bark was added to the bole by applying bark factors, also shown in the appendix. This value, wood and bark, is reported as total bole weight.

['he next step was to add the top to the bole. Top factors were derived from tariff table used by FIA at the PNW Station. Evaluation of the relationshipof top to main portion of the bole showed very little variation by species. Therefore, average values for ali species were applied to the bole weight figures. These values are shown in the appendix.

Weight of ali branches was then added to the total weight of the entire bole. This

was accomplished I:y applying branch factors from published sources tothe bole

weight figures. Many sources were used to develop the branch factors. Where

different sources gave widely different values for branches an average value was

.

f

chosen. This, of course, was the norm rather than the exception. A summary of

branch factors is shown in the appendix.

Forsome areas the numberof smalltrees was not identifiedin theFIA reports.Fortheseareas total weight taken from a 1980 biomass assessment (U.S. Department of Agriculture1981a).

The proportionof otherbiomass,topand branches, was cornputedusingthe proportionsdevelopedfor the 1980 compilation(U.S. Der_artmer_otl Agriculture1981a).

Weight of salvable dead trees was computed by converting FIA inventory volumeto dry or green weight usingthe average densityvaluesnoted above.

Otherma,_eriapl,rimarilycrownsoftrees llarvested,has notbeenestimatedona regionalbasis.The -_lume ofadditional residuelr, the smallersizescouldbe in excessof 20 dry tonsper acre (Maxwell and Ward 1976). Estimatesof loggingresiduevolumeandweightwere derived from publisheddata for each area (Howard1981a, 1981b; Howardand Fiedler 1984; Howardand Seizer 1989). Informationin Tables 18, 19, 21, 22, and 23 was taken directlyfrom these reports. Weight informationin Table 20 was derived by applyingdry weight valuesto cubicfoot loggingresiduevolumes. Total residueweight for each area (Table 12)was computedby multiplyingthe average weightof residue per 1,000 board feet of timber harvestby the total boardfootvolumeof timberharvest.Thiswas donefor eachownership/h3rvest methodrepresentedin eacharea. Totalweightfortheareawas the sumofthese computations.
Energy values, Btu's, were computedfor portionsof theforest biomassof the 5State areathat were considered to be the .mostlikely conversion opportunities. This includes crowns of growing stock trees, small trees, cull trees, and logging residue. No information is given on the amount of these sources that might actually be available for energy conversion, nor is tb .,_un_tion made that ali of this material should in fact be used for that purpose. Energy values, expressed in Btu's per pound, vary considerably by species and type of

Figure3: Total land area by classificationby resourcearea
A considerable amount of timber exists on Other Forest Land throughout the 5state area. The proportion of this land classification ranges from 4-28 percent of the total land base. Timber on this land is not reeadilly available for harvest, either by being withdrawn from production by statute, or by nature of its quality, species, or remoteness. A certain amount of wood from these lands might enter the energy market in the future. No effort has been made to estimate these quantities in this report. Future biomass assessment, however, may incorporate thi_ in;ormation.

Of the 80 million acres of timberland, roughly two-thirds is in public ownership (table 2). National Forests account for about 55 percent of the total, with Bureau of Land Management and State lands being the next largest owner groups. AS shown in figure 4, the highest proportion of public ownership is in southeast Alaska (93 percent)and the lowest in southwest Washington (41 percent). Western Washington has the highest percentage ofland in private ownership of ali the areas, an average of about 58 percent, over 60 percent of which is owned by forest industries. Other Private holdings are highestin Montana and the Puget Sound area of Washington. Ranches and farms are a major component of this ownership in Montana, while miscellaneous private owners predominate the Puget Sound area.

Figure 6: Percent of timberland by forest I[ype by resource area
Table 14 (in the appendix) shows area of timberland by cubic-foot site class. This classification is an attempt to define the basic growth capability of a stand. Stands with the highest potential can produce in excess of 225 cubic feet per acre per year. Those with the lowest potential produce less than 49 cubic feet per acre per year. Stands capable of producing 120 cubic feet or more per year' are considered as sites with good growth potential. The data in table 14 show that almost 30 percent of the timberland is capable of producing 120 cubic feet per acre per year. These stands are not uniformly distributed. Roughly 72 percent of stands with this growth potential are located in the western parts of Oregon and Washington. Data on site class are not available for southeast Alaska, thus the above figures do not include the Alaska acreage.
Stands with a relatively high level of productivity, are also the stands that produce high quantities of total biomass. On the other hand, stands with lower

The Biomass Resource

productivity,like Iodgepolepine. often represent a good potentialfor wood energy due to the smaller size and lowerqualitytree that occurs on the site. Treeswiththese characteristicsare frequentlynothighlydemandedforconventionalproducts.Thus, the proportionof biomassin these standsavailablefor energy is relativelyhigh, in some cases nearly 100 percent. These data are usefulfor aeterminingthe relativegrowthpotentialof stands.As the examples above indicate,however,growthpotentialis not directlycorrelatedwith wood energy supplies.
The estimated total quantity of woody biomass for the 5-State area is 4.425 billion bone dry tons (table 4). As notedearlier totaltree biomassrefers to the above groundweightof a tree above a 1.0 foot stump,and exclusiveof foliage; includedare smalltrees, thosefrom 1.0 - 4.9 inchesin diameter;cull trees;and salvabledead trees.

handled by harvesting equipment or transported to conversion facilities.
Biomass is distributed somewhat differently than acreage of timberland among the 11 resource areas covered by this report. Figure 7 below shows a comparison of proportion of acres of timberland to proportion of total biomass for eacharea. Noticeable is the difference in these proportions between the wetter and drier areas. Idaho, Montana, eastern Oregon, and eastern Washington have higher percents of timberland than biomass, while the other, wetter, areas exhibit

the opposite situation. Grea_erquantities of biomass may represent greater opportunities for energy conversion, although this is not always the case.

Figure7: Proportionof totaltimberlandcomparedto proportion of total biomassby area
ASmight be expected the largestportion of the total is represented by sawtimber trees, those greater than 11.0 inches in diameter. Figure 8 shows the distribution of total biomass by class of timber. While sawtimber trees accountfor the largest share of the total, the distribution by class of timber is not uniform when comparing the different areas. Montana, for example differs considerably from the other areas. The sawtimber portion in Montana is the lowest among the areas, at 55 percent, while poletimber trees account for 31 percent, highest among the 11 areas. Also notable is the relatively high proportion of biomass in salvable dead trees. This ismost likely attributable to the high incidence of beetle killed Iodgepole pine trees. Southeast Alaska on the other hand has 83 percent of its biomass in sawtimber trees and only 9 and 2 percent respectively in poletimber and seedling/sapling trees.

The proportionoftotalbiomassin small,cull,and salvabledeadtrees isrelatively smallin ali areas, rangingfrom 5-15 percent. These classesoftimber do offer someopportunityfor energy conversion,usuallyin conjunctionwith regularor salvage harvest operations.Cull and dead trees are usuallyscattered throughout the forests, the exception being treeskilled by fire or insects and diseases. Small trees are found both as components of stands with larger trees and as entire stands, particularly following harvesting, in most situations they offer lirnitedconversion opportunities, at least until they reach the rize where thinning becomes a management alternative.
Publiclands accountfor about three quarters of the 4 billiondry tonsof woody biomass from growing stock tree,,.;(table 15, in appendix). National Forests contribute nearly 60 percent, while other public owners account for just over 16 percent. The National Forest figure is only an estimate since a breakdown by ownership is not available for southeast A_aska(at the date of the inventories used as a basis for this report). In terms of acres of timberland, National Forests in southeastAlaska accountfor almost90 percentof the total. This proportion was used to develop the National Forest estimate noted above.
With some exceptions National Forestlands also have the Ilighest per acre amounts of biomass, ranging from 28.52 tons per acre, dry weight, in Idaho to 123.63 tons per acre, _Jryweight, in West Central Oregon (table 6). Averages for ali owners range from 29.2'; tons per acre, dry weight, in Idaho to 81.42 tons per acre, dry weight, in the Olympic Peninsula area of Washington. Ownership breakdown is was not available Ior southeast Alaska when data for this report were compiled. Thus, the range of biomass weights may differ when the Alaska data are known.

Bark is included w!th the bole because most of it is attached to the bole wh/_n harvested and transported to the conversion facility. An unknown quantilt of bark is knocked off trees during harvest. When evaluating the additional quantity of biomass that may be available during harvest, bark should not be considered. Much of the bark is subsequently converted to enetrgyor other products at the receiving facility.

The proportion of crown to total tree biomass does not differ much between areas. At first thought this might not be expected. Particularly since the proportion does vary by species. From table 7 the amount of crown in softwood trees varies from '12.7to 21.8 percent of total biomass. The higher figure is in Montana. The next highest proportion of crown matedal is in Idaho, at 17.5 percent, and is closer to that of the other areas. The reason for the relatively high proportion in Montana is not known. The proportion of hardwood crown material exhibits roughly the same pattern between the areas. There is also little difference in the proportion of crown to total biomass between softwoods and hardwoods. For ali areas and species crown biomass averages 16.3 percent.

Size is the biggest factor in amount of biomass per tree. The proportion of bole and crown materials is also related to tree size. As noted above harvest usually occurs in stands of largertrees, while silvicultural activities are directed at stands in earlier stages of development. While different, both situations offer opportunities for the use of woody biomass for energy. Table 9 shows the distribution of total biomass by diameter class. This data differs from that in prior tables in that treel 'ess than 5.0 inches in diameter are included.

The distributior_ of biomass by diameter class differs considerably between the resource areas. This distribution is depicted in figure 9. As can be seen there are some interesting differences in the si ,-'_,class distributiOns. For example, in Montana 55percent of total biomass is in trees less than 1 1.0 inches in diameter. "]his compares to a 5-State average of only 28 percent in this samesize range. There are a number of factors that lead to this size distribution, one of which is that nearly 30 percent of biomass in Montana is accounted for by Iodgepole pine, usually occurring as stands of relatively small di_meter trees. Just the opposite occurs in southeast Alaska where trees less than 11.0 inches account for only 11 percent of total biomass in the area. Another unique situation occurs in western Oregon. Two resource areas, Southwest and West Central, account for 38 percent of biomass in trees greater than 29.0 inches. The other area with a high proportion of biomass in this size class of tree is southeast Alaska, having about 17 percent of the 5-State total. As figure 9 shows the interior areas tend to have a higher proportion of biomass in trees less than 11.0 inches than do the coastal areas.

Table 10 gives the dry weight of net annual growth for each of the 11 resource areas. These figures represent growth on only the bole portion of trees. Increments of crown biomass tlave not been estimated for this report. The total net annual growth of ali 11 areas is approximately 52 million dry tons. A comparison to annual removals (harvest plus logging residue and other types of removals) is not readily available. For the most part removals are reported in units otherthan weight. The latest National assessment (U.S. Department of Agriculture 1981b) gives removals in cubic faet. Using average dry density factors calculated for this report, the above reported removals equals approximately 51 million dry tons. Even with the differences in data bases and inventory dates the two estimates indicate that growth and removals are roughly in balance. Table 17 in the appendix gives per acre figures for net annual growth for each resource area.

Biomass left in the wOodsfollowing logging operations has been the focus of many feasibility studies since the energy crises of the mid-1970's. Aside from by-products from the forest products industries, this potential source of wood is usually considered to be the most likely to be converted to energy. Most often economics have played a key role in determining the rate at which this biomass is actually recovered for energy uses. ]'he highest degree of recovery is currently occurring in California, spurred by construction of numerous wood fired power plants overthe past 10years. While recovery of logging residue has not beenvery high, lower amounts are being left now than in the past. Irl the future we can expect higher levels of utilization during harvest, which means less logging residue. Until that time rather large total quantities of residue will be available for potential conversion to energy, lt should be noted that not ali logging residue is available for energy or any off-site product. Other resource considerations, such as site productivity and wildlife habitat, will require that some amount of biomass needs to remain on site. The amount associated with these needs is not well defined atthis time.
Table 11 shows the total gross and net weight of logging residue by resource area. No breakdown is given for resource areas within western Oregon and western Washington. The total net weight, 17.2 million dry tons, is about 62 percent of the total gross weight, 27.8 million dry _ons.This means that the average usable cor=tenot f the residue is 62tons per every 1O0tons. Manyfactors affectthe economic and physical feasibility of using residual materials for energy. The relation of net to gross weight by area is shown in figure 10.

Figure10:Grossand net weightof loggingresidueby area

Size, recoverable volume, location, and policies of land owners are examples of such factors. Some information needed to make feasibility assessments is provided in tables in the appendix of this report. Data given in tables 21-23 in the appendix can be used to determine the allocation of these weights by diameter and length classes, whether the material was liveor dead o/cull at the time of harvest, and provides information on the number of pieces per acre. Also included in the appendix are factors (tables 18-20) that can be used to estimate gross and net volumes of logging residue by owner class. These factors were the basis for the weight estimates shown in table 11. As table 11 shows about 7.4 million dry tons of residue comes from clearcut harvesting. This is 43 percent of the17.2 million ton total. Some clearcutting does occur in the areas

where residue is shown under the "ali methods".Thus,thetotalweightofresidue from clearcuttingis a little higher that indicated above. Also notable is the distributionof residuebygeographicarea.

lt shouldbe notedthat the logging residueweightsprovided in this report are not additive to the total weight of the biomass inventory (table 4). The inventory figure includes the biomass of ali trees, above a 1.0 foot stump (excluding foliage). The logging residue figure includes parts of trees that remain on site following a logging operation. As such, residue biomass has been included in the inventory estimate. The term logging residue only defines the disposition of some biomass at the time of harvest.
Energy potential as expressed here is defined as the maximum amount of energy that wouldbe availableif the stated sourcewas fully convertedat the highestlevelof efficiency.Thisof courseis notf_asiblenor necessarilydesirable in the real world.The value offiguresreportedhereis foridentificationof those areas or sourceswith the greatest potential for energy production.Table 12 showstheenergypotentialby sourceof biomassforeach geographicarea.

The logging residue figure is based on estimated annual quantities of residue created as a result of current levels of timber harvesting. The other biomass energy sources are based on standing inventory data, and as such would be available for conversion to energy over a considerable time period. No attempt has been made to estimate the time period over which this material might enter the energy market. As will be discussed below there are other sources of woody

Changing harvest technology, coupled with growing demand for ali wood produc_s,may resultin a differentutilizationrate forthese smallertree componentsin thefuture.Aswe lookintothe futurewe willbe payinglessattentionto what we now call loggingresidue and more to total biomass management. Eventuallythe term loggingresiduewillbecomeobsolete.
Figure13:Smallsizeresidue(lessthan3.0 inches)suchasthismaybe available for energy.
The amountof loggingresiduethat mightentertheenergymarketundercurrent circumstancesis a functionof cost of irecovery,transportationdistance, and energyvalues. Ali of these are in relationto locationof the conversionfacility. WhatmaybefeasibleinwesternWastlington,may notbe economicallypossible in the moresparselytimberedareasin Idaho and Montana.Thus, sitespecific analysesareneededto determinetheamountofresiduethatmay be converted intoenergy. A recentreport to the U. S. Departmentof Energy (Envirosphere 1986 a,b) provides supplycurves for logging residuefor the five state area encompassingRegionX of DOE. This informationmaybe usefulin makingthe economic assessments needed to determine the=feasibility of converting residueto energyfor a specificlocationin the 5-State area.

Cull/Dead trees--Energy potentialfromthis sourceis fairlysignificant,nearly 4 quads.A keyquestionforthesesources,however,isavailability.Forthe most partcull and dead treesare scatteredthroughouttheforestsof the5-State area, an exceptionbeing concentrationsof dead trees caused by incidentssuch as insect epidemics. Trees in this classificationtend to be associatedwith older stands,with areas like southeastAlaska and southwestOregon,where large acreages of older standsexist,havinghigherconcentrationsof biomassin cull and dead trees. Absolutequantities,and thereforeopportunitiesfor recoveryof thismaterialforenergy,are higherfortheseareasthanforareaswhere younge_r forestspredominate.
Figure14:Culltrees,whichcontainlogslikethis, and deadtrees are a significantbut widelysctatteredresource.
The scattered nature of cull and dead trees inhibits their recovery for energy because of higher harvesting costs. As a result, biomass from these sources is generally associated with normal harvesting operations, or salvage sales. Even the salvage sales tend to produce a high proportion of product recovery for other uses. In areas with flatter terrain, characteristic of the ponderosa pine type east of the Cascades, there are greater opportunities for recovery of cull and dead trees. This is due largely to lower harvesting costs and the partial cut practices that are common to these areas. For most areas it is likely that good energy markets might spur recovery of additional amounts of cull and dead biomass.

Tree crowns--Crowns of live trees comprisesthe single largest source of biomassin the 5-State area, over 11 quads. As defined earlierthis does not includefoliage,whichwould add considerablyto this total. Obviouslycrowns shouldnotbe consideredas a sourcefor energyconversionindependentofthe entiretree. Nor shouldthe total amountof potentialenergy be consideredas beingavailablefor energyproduction.The forestresourcewillbe managedand harvestedin conjunctionwith a complexset of societaland ownersobjectives. As trees are deemed ready for harvestthe crown portionthen comesintothe energyequation.As is the case for loggingresidues, some quantityof crown materialmay be left on siteto enhance or protectotherenvironmentalconsiderationsor forfuturesite productivityH. owmuchof thismaterialneedstobe left onsiteisunderinvestigationandwillprobablyvary considerablyfromone area to another.

Figure15: Recoveryof biomassfromthinningsmalltreesmay bean importantsourceof woodfor energyin the future.

Reducing the density of overstocked stands is usually accomplished by thinning operations. In many operations, called pre-commercial thinnings, unwanted trees are cut and left to decay, providinggreater growing space for remaining desirable trees. These procedures are expensive and usually do not result in removal of products until the trees are larger; the operations are then called commercial thinnings. The smallertrees have rarely had much product value, off site that is. This has contributed to a lower ttlan desirable level of thinning operations for most land owners. A viable market for small trees might change the situ_ationconsiderably. First, additional biomass might be recovered from current or planned operations. Secondly, the ability to generate some income from these operations might create opportunities for additional thinnings that would otherwise be passed over. While thinnings do take piace, there are thousands of acres of forests irl the 5-State area that could benefit from thinning, but are being delayed because of high treatment costs, lt is these stands, along with some having slightly larger trees, that rePresent a significant opportunity to recover energy wood. The extent and feasibility of these opportunities are unique to each location, Availability to energy markets may be a key to more intensive forest management in the future.

In addition to woody biomass currently being converted to energy, primarily in the forest industries and for residential heating, the forests of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska represent a significarlt opportunity to help meet future energy needs. The extent to which these forests contribute is a function of a complex set of criteria, and varies considerably from one geographic area to another. Expanding the useof woody biomass for energy holds promise not only for meeting growing demands, but may provide an economic incentive for intensifying management of the region's forests. Obviously only a small portion of the nearly 19 quads of energy from the sources in this rePortwill be physically available in any given year. Even less may find its way to markets because of critical economic factors. But, the amount that does reach conversion facilities can make a significant and lasting contribution to the region's energy requirements. Unlike other sourcesof energy, woody biomass is a renewable resource.
There are other sources of forest biomass not addressed by this report. The largest such source is biomass occurring on what are frequently referred to as non-commercial forests. Juniper stands in eastern Oregon and Washington are examples of this type of forest. Data in table 1 showed a total of just over 25 million acres of "otherforest land" in the 5-State ar,ea.Muchof this land is covered with trees that are not generally considered to bf, of commercial value. Eastern Oregon alone has over 3.6 million acres of othi_rforest land, most of which is occupied by non-commercial species (Farrenkopf 1982). The very definition of these stands indicates that few products are removed from trees growing on these sites. In some cas_.sproducts such as posts, poles,and firewood are taken from these forests. Large scale removal of biomass from these forests may not be reasonable for a number of reasons. They do, however, represent a potentially large source of biomass, particularly for products that do not require high quality wood--such as energy.
Reliability of data for most of the sources of biomass presented in this report is difficult to assess. Each of the Forest Service reports from which inventory

Eonclusion

!

volumeswere derived, gives information on sampling errors for land area and

volume. These sampling errors, however, do not apply to the total biomass

estimates in this report, which were constructed by applying factors to the basic

inventory estimates. Thus, sampling errors for total tree biomass estimates by

resource area were not determined. The main stem of a tree accounts for the

largest proportion of total tree biomass, and the sampling errors associated with thls portion are relatively low as indicated in the Forest Service rel_rts.

Therefore, the combined error associated with total tree biomass in almost ali cases will be lower than that for the non-stem portion of a tree. For example, standard error of 5 percent for the main stem and 25 percent for the other

biomass components, could result in a combined error as low as 10 percent for total tree biomass, because the biomass of the main stem accounts for such a

large proportion of the total biomass of the tree. The data presented here provides information on the relative size and distribution of biomass for the resources areas. Site specific needs should be metby deriving estimates from

the localdata base. Standard errors for logging residue estimates are available in the referenced reportsl Since total residue estimates rely on actual harvest figures, errors associated with the.totals should bethe same as those associated with the estimators themselves.

Whether augmenting regional supplies or facilitating forest management, the use of woody biomass for energy has the potential to impact both people and forests of the region. Energy markets in the 5-State area are currently not conducive to rapidgrowth in the use of woodybiomass. Likewise, there are many gaps in harvesting and processing technologies needed to support this growth. Finally, we do not fully understand the role of woody biomass in the enhancement and protection of the forest environment. Time, however, will see changes in ali three elements: markets, technology, management, lt is anticipated that woody biomass will play a larger rol¢_in future energy production. The extent and rapidity with which this may occur ,Isunknown. Another unknown, and a potentially major consideration, is the et,_ectof international energy demands and politics on utilization of the region's forest biomass. While not widely discussed,

the potential exists for forests within the 5-State area to become significant sources of wood for the many nations in the world that are facing serious shortages of fuel for cooking and heating, ltwould not be unreasonable to expect these countries to look toward the U.S. for assistance with this critical issue. Following the example ofother commodities, we could easily see a flow of woody biomass to some of these countrie_ within a matter of years.
How much and when are the main questions concerning the use of woody biomass for energy. Possibly where should be added to that list. The resource available to support this use is large and spread throughout the 5-State area of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. A great deal of research, development, and innovation will occur as we move toward the year 2000. Ali three will be necessary to ensure efficient and effective management of this important resource.
