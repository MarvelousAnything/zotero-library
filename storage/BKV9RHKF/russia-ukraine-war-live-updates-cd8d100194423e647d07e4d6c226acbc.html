Russian oil imports to the United States, an effort to put into law the 
restrictions announced by President Joe Biden in response to the

told an informal U.N. Security Council meeting on Climate Finance for

 was increasing concern Wednesday over the safety of the decommissioned 
Chernobyl nuclear plant, which Russian troops seized early in the

And there is also concern about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the 
largest in Europe, which Russia seized last week.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 United States is responding by banning the import of Russian oil, 
liquefied natural gas and coal, “and many other nations are now

 his country believes that stability in energy markets is critical to 
the global economy.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 UAE is a longtime member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
 Countries, which last week, along with its oil-producing allies

 oil production rather that opening the spigots further.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The

 told Scholz about Russian “efforts to organize humanitarian corridors 
for civilians to exit areas of fighting and attempts by militants from

Wednesday that it has a “duty of care” to all its 2,500 employees in

 since 1991.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“Furthermore,

 — The international Red Cross says civilians caught up in places

 International Committee of the Red Cross, which in particular is trying
 to arrange evacuations of civilians from the hard-hit port city of

Russian border. Ukrainian authorities have rejected that idea.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">ICRC
 has said authorities on both sides need to agree on any evacuation

 civilians might refuse evacuation “if the only escape route available 
to them implies resettling in the Russian Federation or the Republic of 
Belarus,” said ICRC spokesman Jason Straziuso in an email, referring to 
Russian ally Belarus. “In the view of the ICRC, civilians affected by 
the hostilities should be given broader relocation alternatives,

Compressed layout (automatic embed)\u003c/div>\u003cp>Chelsea has won five Premier League titles under Abramovich along with two Champions League titles, the latest last year. Victory in the Club World Cup last month completed the set of major honors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The success has been funded by around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) of loans to the club that Abramovich said he didn't want repaid when putting the club up for sale last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHY SANCTION ABRAMOVICH?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich has used legal means to try to publicly distance himself from benefiting from an association with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The British government thinks otherwise, saying Abramovich has obtained “a financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the government of Russia,\" including tax breaks, the sale of shares at favorable rates, and contracts in the buildup to Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich “is or has been involved in destabilizing Ukraine” via Evraz, a steel manufacturing and mining company which he effectively controls and has potentially supplied the Russia military, the government said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His fortune was made in oil and aluminium following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2005, Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom paid $13 billion for the Sibneft oil company controlled by Abramovich. It allowed Putin’s Kremlin to recapture state influence in the lucrative energy industry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON CHELSEA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The sanctions could have immediately forced Chelsea to stop running as a business, and preventing its teams from completing their seasons. Instead, a special license has been issued to allow it to continue operating, subject to heavy restrictions.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Only fans already with tickets — mainly season ticket holders — can attend matches, shutting out away fans from games. The club's shop had to close on Thursday morning. Staff at the hotel built onto Stamford Bridge said they were under orders to no longer accept new reservations or sell food and drink.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Only 500,000 pounds ($657,000) can be spent on staging each match at Stamford Bridge, including on security and catering. A maximum of 20,000 pounds can be spent on travel to matches. Chelsea plays in France at Lille in the Champions League next week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Player recruitment is also prohibited under the terms of the government license that runs through May 31. There are players with contracts expiring at the end of the season in June and the sanctions create uncertainty over whether Cesar Azpilicueta, Toni Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen could be offered new deals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>CAN CHELSEA STILL BE SOLD?\u003c/p>\u003cp>As calls grew in the British parliament for Abramovich to be sanctioned, Chelsea was put up for sale.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated,” Abramovich said. “The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>It gave the impression of being an entity that Abramovich would be involved with. The foundation could have benefited Russian victims, too.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chelsea sought potential bidders to register their interest by next week. But now the government has oversight of the process.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“While the current license does not permit the sale of the club at this time, the government is open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a new license to allow for a sale,” the government said. “Proceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"BorisJohnson","name":"Boris Johnson","canonicalName":"boris-johnson","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-sports","name":"Sports","canonicalName":"sports","isPr":false},{"id":"Soccer","name":"Soccer","canonicalName":"soccer","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-EuropeanSports","name":"Sports -

A firefighter grabbed the boy's hand and his eyes blinked but he was otherwise still. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The city's streets were eerily empty, with most people sheltering indoors. But one man, Aleksander Ivanov, was pulling a trolley with his possessions in search of place to stay because shelling destroyed his home. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At the Brovary Central District Hospital on the eastern outskirts of Kyiv, a 14-year-old girl named Katya lay in bed with the covers pulled up to her neck.

He claimed without providing evidence that the Mariupol hospital had been seized by far-right radical fighters who were using it as a base — despite the fact that photos and videos of the aftermath showed pregnant women and children at the site.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More than 2.3 million people have fled the war in Ukraine and an estimated 1.9 million are displaced within the country, a U.N. official said Thursday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ukrainian forces slowed or stopped a Russian advance that was trying to encircle Kyiv from the north to the west, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said Thursday night. It said Ukrainian forces also drove Russians out of Baklanova Muraviika, a village near Chernihiv that sits on a road to the capital.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Earlier Thursday, that office said Russian forces had captured several Kyiv suburbs, were trying to take Chernihiv and were advancing on the southern cities of Mykolaiv, Kryviy Rih, Voznesensk and Novovorontsovka. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said about 2 million people — half the residents of the Ukrainian capital’s metropolitan area — have left the city, which has become a virtual fortress.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Every street, every house … is being fortified,” he said in televised remarks. “Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Russia has deployed more than 150,000 troops and retains large and possibly decisive advantages in firepower, despite facing fierce Ukrainian resistance and global financial pressure aimed at crippling its economy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Russian forces on Thursday shelled a nuclear research institute in Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, setting buildings on fire, said Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Interior Ministry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Firefighters managed to extinguish the blazes, but Gerashchenko said a shell hit a building that houses equipment that could release radiation if it were damaged. According to the president’s office, there has been no change in the background radiation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Russia’s deputy energy minister, Yevgeny Grabchak, said Thursday that \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-science-business-nuclear-power-physics-4ef041a54e2d9293ec72c58d20e44225\">power was restored\u003c/a> to the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Rafael Grossi, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters Thursday in Vienna that the nuclear watchdog had ”scheduled physical inspections” of Ukraine's nuclear facilities, though he when or how those inspections would take place.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ABOUT DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Several rounds of talks between Ukraine and Russia haven't stopped the fighting, and a meeting Thursday in Turkey between Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, failed to find common ground.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In their highest-level talks since the war began, the two sides discussed a 24-hour cease-fire but didn't make progress toward one, Kuleba said. He said Russia was still seeking “surrender from Ukraine.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is not what they are going to get,” he said, adding that he was willing to continue the dialogue.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lavrov said Russia was ready for more negotiations but showed no sign of softening Moscow’s demands. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Russia has alleged that Western-looking, U.S.-backed Ukraine poses a threat to Russian security. Western officials suspect Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to install a Moscow-friendly government in Kyiv as part of an effort to draw the former Soviet state back into its orbit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>French President Emmanuel Macron joined the ranks of Western leaders who have condemned the Russian airstrike on the Mariupol hospital, calling it “a shameful and amoral act of war.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>During a visit to Poland, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-harris-embraces-calls-for-war-crimes-probe-792555553cca39ef9e1b4f1e7f8cebe6\">embraced calls for an international investigation\u003c/a>, though she stopped short of directly accusing Russia of having committed war crimes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT DEFENSIVE ASSISTANCE IS UKRAINE GETTING?\u003c/p>\u003cp>European nations have sent weapons to Ukraine’s military. Furthermore, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday night that \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-us-aid-package-41cc2e66c7714b37eca9d2bb8add53aa\">would rush $13.6 billion in American aid\u003c/a> to Ukraine and its European allies, nearly half of that for sending troops and weapons to Eastern Europe and equipping allied forces there. The bill is expected to pass through the Senate as well in the coming days.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Ukrainian government says about 20,000 foreigners have joined the so-called the International Legion for the Territorial Defense of Ukraine, where they are given weapons to fight when they arrive. Among them are about 100 of the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-d0243a1708a3115e5ad0ac40aed99b9f\">several thousand Americans\u003c/a> who asked to join the fight, a Ukrainian official said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT’S THE VIEW FROM INSIDE RUSSIA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>During a televised meeting with Kremlin officials on Thursday, Putin addressed the Western sanctions that have caused the ruble to crash and led many major companies to leave Russia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The pressure of sanctions has always been there. Yes, of course, now it is complex and creates certain challenges, problems, difficulties for us. But just as we overcame these difficulties in the previous years, we will overcome them now. We must go through this period. The economy will certainly adapt to the new situation.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>The list of companies that have stopped operating in Russia grew Thursday, with German fashion brand Hugo Boss temporarily closing its stores and U.S.-based hotel chains Hilton and Marriott closing their Moscow offices, though their Russian hotels are owned and operated by franchisees and will stay open. The Walt Disney Co. said that in addition to pausing film releases in Russia, as previously announced, it was also “taking steps to pause all other businesses” there. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Goldman Sachs said it would close its operations in Russia entirely, making it the first major Wall Street bank to do so since Russia invaded Ukraine. And JPMorgan Chase said it was “unwinding” its Russian banking business.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-technology-business-europe-media-f1da10285a1631542b332597c5d35c29\"> Twitter launched a privacy-protected version\u003c/a> of its site to bypass surveillance and censorship after Russia restricted access to its service in the country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow the AP’s coverage of the war between Russia and Ukraine: \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine \u003c/a>\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"reporterKeys":["afs:Reporter:871710412919"],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false,"canonicalUrl":"russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-business-europe","urlUpdated":null}},"loadedAt":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:cd8d100194423e647d07e4d6c226acbc":1646953888085,"urn:publicid:ap.org:381a42b2a97f933ff1e336983c7a8101":1646953888553,"urn:publicid:ap.org:5b306e611d2a7fc3d20165a54cf38062":1646953888564,"urn:publicid:ap.org:bf2bcfb3a499d688e3075f2d4cf54989":1646953888599},"expiration":120000},"medium":{"loading":{},"error":{},"data":{"148a87011df6410fa1648fe0dcce4f60":{"id":"148a87011df6410fa1648fe0dcce4f60","type":"YouTube","caption":"\u003cp>Video from outside Kyiv captures blast\u003c/p>","order":3,"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","imageFileExtension":".jpeg","imageRenderedSizes":[1920,1000,800,600,400,200],"aspectRatio":1.77777777777778,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/148a87011df6410fa1648fe0dcce4f60/","embedCaption":null,"uploaded":true,"flattenedCaption":"Video from outside Kyiv captures blast","updated":"2022-03-10T23:05:05.779176","alignment":"middle","videoMimeType":"video/mpeg","videoFileExtension":".mp4","videoRenderedSizes":[640],"externalId":"sKSz3_yj1x8","audioMimeType":null,"audioFileExtension":null,"title":null,"noEmbedCaption":false},"9732e3040b43404084ca8620cbf14349":{"id":"9732e3040b43404084ca8620cbf14349","type":"YouTube","caption":"\u003cp>A four-star hotel in Romania has turned its lavish ballroom into a makeshift refugee shelter for some of the thousands crossing the borders from neighbouring Ukraine each day.\u003c/p>","order":5,"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","imageFileExtension":".jpeg","imageRenderedSizes":[1920,1000,800,600,400,200],"aspectRatio":1.77777777777778,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/9732e3040b43404084ca8620cbf14349/","embedCaption":null,"uploaded":true,"flattenedCaption":"A four-star hotel in Romania has turned its lavish ballroom into a makeshift refugee shelter for some of the thousands crossing the borders from neighbouring Ukraine each day.","updated":"2022-03-10T23:05:08.206148","alignment":"middle","videoMimeType":"video/mpeg","videoFileExtension":".mp4","videoRenderedSizes":[640],"externalId":"mi3f4PIWjlw","audioMimeType":null,"audioFileExtension":null,"title":null,"noEmbedCaption":false},"897a71e3a87d4fd299d17631af33c5ed":{"id":"897a71e3a87d4fd299d17631af33c5ed","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>Ukrainian emergency employees work at the side of the damaged by shelling maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 9, 2022.
