End Discrimination and Hate Crimes: SPHERE UKRAINE Write for Rights 2021

Ukraine Discrimination

In this human rights education activity, participants explore how general assumptions about people and groups can lead to discrimination and fuel violence, stigma and hate crimes. Participants will learn why guaranteeing the right to non-discrimination is particularly essential for people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex, and that the state has responsibility for this.
