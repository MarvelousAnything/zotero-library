A highly educated workforce and low cost of labor made Ukraine an attractive outsourcing tech hub for Fortune 500 firms, churning out more than 200,000 IT workers.

But these days, Andrew Pavliv, the founder and CEO of N-iX, one of Ukraine’s largest tech companies, is more consumed with managing the flow of employees within his own country. Since the Russian invasion began last month, Pavliv’s firm has evacuated nearly 200 employees from hard hit cities in eastern Ukraine, including Kharkiv to the relative safety of N-iX’s office in Lviv, along the Polish border. Twenty-two of the company's specialists have left their jobs temporarily, to fight for the Ukrainian military.

“It was really hard days since the beginning of the war ... there were interruptions in the services because people were moving with their families. They were finding places here, where to stay,” Pavliv said. “Last week, we checked our service delivery capabilities. And for some of the clients, we even did deliver 100% of services. For some of our clients, we delivered about 80% to 85% of services.”

The fighting in Ukraine has put a spotlight on the country’s budding IT sector, and its increasing importance to the global tech supply chain. Boasting some of the nation’s highest salaries, the sector contributed roughly 4% to Ukraine’s GDP last year, with exports crossing the $5 billion mark for the first time in 2020 .

Andrew Pavliv, the founder and CEO of N-iX, one of Ukraine’s largest tech companies, has been managing the flow of employees within his own country.

For Western firms, those services have proven to be a valuable lifeline as they make the rapid transition to digital. Ukrainian computer code can be found in some of the world’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), aerospace manufacturers like Boeing ( BA ), and carmakers Daimler and BMW. Apple ( AAPL ) and Alphabet ( GOOG ) have maintained a presence in Ukraine to tap into the country’s growing tech talent.

“[Ukranians] are very creative, I would say. So when you need complicated software developments, go to Ukraine. I think this was a factor, in the industry growing 40% to 50% a year,” Pavliv said. “The IT profession here is very popular among the young people, so a lot of universities are growing their faculties for technical professionals.”
Story continues

N-iX has been providing software development services since 2002, partnering with companies all over the world. The company has expanded its presence outside of Ukraine, with offices in Poland, Sweden, Bulgaria, and the U.S.

Pavliv said the constant threat of Russian military attacks have made it difficult to separate work from war, even as his employees work around the clock to provide services without disruption. Last week, a company director managed to hop on a call with a U.S. client, after running out of fuel as he attempted to evacuate from Kyiv. The firm has lost employees who have left to volunteer for the Ukrainian military, though they continue to provide financial support.

Pavliv has delegated much of the firm’s operations to the roughly 1,500 employees now operating out of western Ukraine, largely isolated from the fighting. But he remains wary of the impact the war will have on his company, the longer the attacks continue.

He said many of his international clients have largely been understanding of any service delays, and pitched in with huge donations to help the country. But he is also bracing for the worst, sourcing buses for female employees looking to cross the border, and work out of Poland instead.

“We think the situation will be like that for the future, like for the next month ... a few months,” he said.

    Why Amazon Stock Popped Today

    Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) were moving higher today after the tech giant surprised the market by announcing a 20-for-1 stock split and a $10 billion share-repurchase authorization. Amazon has historically eschewed shareholder-friendly moves like stock splits and share buybacks, focusing instead on reinvesting in the business to build long-term value. The stock split, which is scheduled to take effect on June 6 pending shareholder approval, does nothing in and of itself to increase the value of the stock.

    Russian energy import freeze would hit Germany as hard as Covid - source

    A short-term freeze on energy imports from Russia resulting from its invasion of Ukraine is likely to cause a collapse in German gross domestic product similar to that prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a study distributed by a German economy ministry source on Thursday. Rating agency Scope cut its 2022 growth forecast for the German economy to 3.5% from 4.4% following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

    Ukrainians flee amid growing humanitarian crisis: CBS News Flash March 9, 2022

    Officials are sounding the alarm over a growing humanitarian crisis nearly two weeks jnto Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The U.N. now estimates two million Ukrainians have fled the country but millions more remain trapped. The port city of Mariupol is reportedly encircled by Russian troops, a situation the Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister calls "catastrophic." Countries around the world are offering supplies to Ukrainian forces. In a rare move, Japan lifted self-imposed restrictions to send a shipment of bulletproof vests. Poland proposed a plan to send fighter jets to Ukrainian forces using a U.S. airbase. The Pentagon rejected the plan over concerns it would escalate the conflict further.

    President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that sanctions imposed against Russia would rebound against the West, including in the form of higher food and energy prices, and Moscow would solve its problems and emerge stronger. Putin said there had been no alternative to what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine and that Russia was not a country which could accept compromising its sovereignty for some sort of short-term economic gain. "These sanctions would have been imposed in any case," Putin told a meeting of the Russian government.
