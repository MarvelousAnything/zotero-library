As the world reels from  Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Russian President  Vladimir Putin 's apparent indifference to the sanctions imposed against his country thus far, calls are growing across the globe for Putin to be hit with financial pain that he cannot ignore.

One way of doing that is to cut Russia off from access to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the main global network that allows financial institutions to send and receive information on international bank transfers. 

SWIFT is incorporated and headquartered in Belgium with 26 offices across the world, providing messaging services to banks in more than 200 countries. It is overseen by the central banks of the G-10, comprised of Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, Switzerland and Sweden.

Russia seizes Chernobyl nuclear site, Ukrainian official claims

Russian forces entering Ukraine from Belarus have taken control of Chernobyl, the decommissioned nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s Deputy Minister of Energy claimed Thursday.

Demchenkov Yaroslav claimed that the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate informed him that the Chernobyl, including all installations and repositories, “is fully controlled” by Russian forces.

The plant was the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident when a nuclear reactor exploded in April 1986 , spewing radioactive waste across Europe.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other government officials earlier claimed that Russian forces stationed in Belarus were trying to seize Chernobyl as Russian incursions continued across the country. 

A Ukraine advisor to Interior Ministry Anton Gerashchenko had said in an earlier Facebook post that the Russian forces entered the exclusion zone from Belarus and that Ukrainian national guardsmen were “fighting hard” to defend the area. 

The plant lies in northern Ukraine, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of the capital of Kyiv. The nuclear incident happened while Ukraine was still part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).

The exploded reactor has been covered by a protective shelter to prevent radiation leak and the entire plant has been decommissioned.

"Videos and other content posted on social media … are part of Russia’s information warfare doctrine," former Defense Intelligence Agency officer Rebekah Koffler told Fox News Digital. "The goal is to favorably predispose Russia’s population to the government’s actions, in this case, military incursion into Ukraine; and to sway foreigners who are sympathetic to Russia, to see the Russian side of the story."

US ambassador: ‘Now is not the time to sit on the sidelines’

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield is urging members of the General Assembly Wednesday to “get off of the sidelines and let us together show Russia that it is isolated and alone in its aggressive actions.” 

“Let us show Russia that every other U.N. member state believes that it is time to de-escalate, to come back to the negotiating table and to work toward peace, so Ukrainians can live in security and the tenets of the U.N. charter can be upheld for future generations to come,” she added. 

Thomas-Greenfield also said a larger military conflict in Ukraine could create a massive refugee crisis "with as many as five million more people displaced by Russia's war of choice and putting pressure on Ukraine's neighbors."

US ambassador warns UN members from giving Russia ‘a pass’ on Ukraine

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the General Assembly that Russia is the “aggressor” in the current situation unfolding in Ukraine . 

“There is no middle ground here,” she said. “Calling for both sides to de-escalate only gives Russia a pass. Russia is the aggressor here.” 

Thomas-Greenfield, referencing Russia’s involvement in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and President Vladimir Putin’s speech earlier this week in which he questioned Ukraine’s existence, also said “Russia’s aggression not only threatens all of Ukraine but every member state in the U.N. itself.” 

“President Putin gave us the clearest indication of his intentions on Monday when he asked the world to travel back in time by more than a 100 years before the United Nations even existed to an age of empires,” Thomas-Greenfield continued. “He asserted that Russia can recolonize its neighbors and that he will use force to make a farce of the United Nations. The United States rejects that firmly.”

Chinese media accidentally posts Communist Party rules on Russia-Ukraine news, hint Taiwan takeover

Chinese news media posted instructions to social platforms about how to approach coverage on Ukraine , including a note of China’s need for Russian "support" with Taiwan. 

One outlet appeared to accidentally post guidelines on what should and should not be published, while an editor from another outlet weighed in with guidance on language and approaches that he believed necessary in walking a fine line. 

Ming Jinwei, senior editor at Xinhua News Agency, wrote in his WeChat blog about how his outlet needed to walk a tight line on its Ukraine coverage, noting that China "has to back Russia up with emotional and moral support while refraining from treading on the toes of the United States and European Union." 

"In the future, China will also need Russia’s understanding and support when wrestling with America to solve the Taiwan issue once and for all," his post read. Ming said that it "doesn’t hurt" to use moderately pro-Russia language.

Ukraine foreign minister says crisis is largest in Europe since World War II

Ukraine foreign minister says crisis is largest in Europe since World War II

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has told the United Nations Wednesday in New York that “we are at a critical juncture in world history and our actions today define it for decades to come.” 

Kuleba says his country’s some 40 million residents “only wish to live in peace and prosperity, not in fear, intimidation – not under Russian fire, bombs and shelling.” 

“We are currently in the middle of the largest security crisis in Europe since the second world war,” he continued. “This crisis was created and is being escalated by one side unilaterally – by the Russian Federation.” 

“Russia’s accusations of Ukraine are absurd, Ukraine has never threatened or attacked anyone,” Kuleba also said. “Ukraine has never planned and does not plan any such action. Ukraine has never planned and does not plan any military offensive in the Donbas [region], neither any provocations or acts of sabotage.” 

“It is ultimately absurd to suggest that Ukraine could have prepared or anything like this and waited for months until Russia amassed an enormous military force along our borders to proceed with such plans," he added. "This absurdity defies basic logic.”

Ukraine confirms new 'mass DDoS attack on state websites in Ukraine'

Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation, says ongoing disruptions of government websites are the result of a “new mass distributed denial-of-service attack," according to Fox News staff on the ground in Ukraine .

"At about 4 pm, another mass DDoS attack on our state began," Fedorov said on the Telegram messaging service. "We have relevant data from a number of banks, and there are also problems with access to the websites of the Verkhovna Rada [parliament] (already in operation), the Cabinet of Ministers and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This is due to switching traffic to another provider to minimize the damage from the attack."

All three websites appeared to be operating again Wednesday after being inaccessible earlier.

Ukraine government websites hit with fresh cyberattacks: reports

The RBC-Ukraine news agency is reporting Wednesday that several government websites have been targeted in a new cyberattack.

The attack is disrupting the websites of the Ukrainian parliament, its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its Cabinet of Ministers, according to reports on Twitter.

All three of the websites currently appear inaccessible.

Last week, a round of cyberattacks brought down websites belonging to Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, army and popular banks, with Ukrainian officials suspecting Russia as the culprit.

In a joint statement Wednesday, Lithuania and Poland -- both close neighbors to Ukraine -- said the eastern European country "deserves EU candidate status and the Republic of Lithuania and the Republic of Poland will support Ukraine in achieving this goal."

"We, the Presidents of Ukraine, the Republic of Poland and the Republic of Lithuania – the Lublin Triangle, gathered in Kyiv on 23 February 2022, express our strongest condemnation of the decision by the Russian Federation to recognize the quasi-entities in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine – the so-called 'Luhansk People’s Republic' and 'Donetsk People’s Republic," the statement read.  

"We urge Russia to de-escalate and to withdraw its armed forces deployed around Ukraine’s borders and in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, and to refrain from taking any further military actions," it added.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that “it is not possible for us to give up on either of them" when speaking about Russia and Ukraine , its Black Sea neighbors.

“We have economic, military and economic ties with Russia. We also have political, military and economic ties with Ukraine... Our aim is to take such a step that we can solve this problem without having to give up on neither of them," Erdogan continued.

Turkey has repeatedly offered to mediate the tensions between Russia and Ukraine.

S&P 500’s correction could deepen if Ukraine-Russia crisis escalates into outright conflict

An armed clash between  Ukraine  and  Russia , coupled with punishing sanctions for Moscow, could push  U.S. stocks  toward another major loss, according to Goldman Sachs economists.

The S&P 500 entered correction territory Tuesday, down 10% from its last peak, as investors weighed the conflict and fresh U.S. and U.K. sanctions on Russia. For the year, it's down over 9%. 

In a note this week, Goldman economist Dominic Wilson said the S&P 500 could drop 6.2% in a scenario in which the crisis escalates and "outright conflict" breaks out. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, could plunge 9.6%. The benchmark is already off over 14% this year. 

"Although Russia/Ukraine tensions appeared to affect primarily local assets in January, spillovers to global assets have been much more obvious in February," the analyst note said. "If risks flare up further, and we shift to an outright conflict scenario coupled with punitive sanctions, the build in political risk premium would very likely extend."

Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs is warning its citizens across the border in Russia to depart "immediately" Wednesday as uncertainty surrounds Russia's next military moves.

"In connection with the intensification of Russian aggression against Ukraine, which, among other things, may lead to significant restrictions on the provision of consular assistance in the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that Ukrainian citizens refrain from any trips to the Russian Federation," it said in a statement.

"We emphasize that ignoring these recommendations will make it much more difficult to ensure proper protection of Ukrainian citizens in the Russian Federation," the statement added.

Ukraine sanctions 351 Russians, including lawmakers 'who voted for dismembering Ukraine'

Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday has approved sanctions against 351 Russians following Moscow's recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk breakaway regions, according to Reuters.

The sanctions restrict movement into Ukraine and prevent those targeted from access to assets, capital, property and business licenses in the eastern European country.

"We should... impose sanctions against criminals, against every deputy of the State Duma of Russia, who voted for dismembering Ukraine," lawmaker Iryna Herashchenko was quoted as saying.

Putin, in new video, calls Russia’s core interests ‘non-negotiable’

Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a video address Wednesday, asserted that the country’s core interests were "non-negotiable" amid tensions with Ukraine – and with the U.S. and other Western nations.

But Putin also said Russia was "always open for direct and honest dialogue," and was willing to address "the most difficult issues" through diplomacy, according to reports.

Putin’s remarks came on Defenders of the Fatherland Day, the Russian equivalent of Veterans Day in the United States, according to Max Seddon, Moscow bureau chief of The Financial Times of Britain.

Russia, Ukraine 'deepfake' video, audio are concerns for US intelligence

As tensions continue to rise in Ukraine and Russia, U.S. intelligence officials are on the watch for manipulated video and audio that could result in multiple cases of misinformation.

The FBI continues to wage a campaign against illegal deepfakes, as the technology continues to improve.

"Audio, video, text and images that are created to show something that didn't necessarily happen, or never occurred," FBI Cyber Division Unit Chief Pranav Shah said of deepfakes.

Shah tells FOX News the technology, once reserved for cyber wizards, is becoming more user-friendly. He says it is getting easier to make these digital deceptions, and they aren't always illegal.

“Once again, the peace of everyone is threatened by vested interests," the pope said.

The Vatican is walking a fine line as the Church has been attempting to reach out to the Russian Orthodox Church and set up a meeting with its leader.

China accuses Taiwan of trying to stir anti-Beijing sentiment over comparisons with Ukraine

China accuses Taiwan of trying to stir anti-Beijing sentiment over comparisons with Ukraine

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen (C) is escorted by Defense Minister Chou Kuo-cheng (L) attending the domestically produced mine laying ships inauguration ceremony at a navy base in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, on January 14, 2022.

After Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen ordered the island's armed forces to be on alert amid tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Beijing on Wednesday balked at the comparison, calling the move "self-serving."

"Taiwan is not Ukraine," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said, according to Reuters. "Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China. This is an indisputable legal and historical fact." Taiwan considers itself an independent state.

Last weekend, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson drew parallels between the Russia-Ukraine situation and mainland China and Taiwan.

“If Ukraine is endangered, the shock will echo around the world," he said at the Munich Security Conference. "And those echoes will be heard in east Asia, will be heard in Taiwan. People would draw the conclusion that aggression pays, and that might is right."

Beijing sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that could be taken by force if deemed necessary.

Beijing Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Ma Xiaoguang accused Taiwan of trying to stir anti-mainland sentiment by playing up "so-called military threats" from China, which he called "self-serving," according to the South China Morning Post.

US sanctions won't 'solve a thing,' Russian ambassador to US says

Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov (R) talks to journalists as employees of the Russian Embassy and their families depart from the Russian Embassy on Jan. 26, 2022.

Sanctions imposed by the White House against Russia “cannot solve a thing" Anatoly Antonov, Russian ambassador to the U.S., told reporters. His response was posted to the embassy's Facebook page.

"I don't remember a single day when our country lived without any restrictions from the Western world," he said. "We have learned to work in such conditions. And not only to survive, but also to develop our state."

He continued, "Anti-Russia sanctions will solve nothing. It is difficult to believe that someone in Washington expects Russia to revise its international political line under the threat of restrictions."

On Tuesday, President Biden announced economic sanctions on Russian banks and Moscow officials, including imposing “full blocking” on two large Russian financial institutions and “comprehensive sanctions” on Russian debt.

Kenyan UN ambassador compares Russia's actions in Ukraine to Africa's history of colonialism

Permanent Representative of Kenya to the UN Martin Kimani seen in New York on Oct. 18, 2021.

Kenyan ambassador to the United Nations Martin Kimani condemned Russia's actions late Monday, drawing parallels to colonialism in Africa, the Washington Post reported.

“This situation echoes our history,” he told the U.N. Security Council in the viral speech. “Kenya and almost every African country was birthed by the ending of empire. Our borders were not of our own drawing. They were drawn in the distant colonial metropoles of London, Paris and Lisbon, with no regard for the ancient nations that they cleaved apart.”

“We must increase the readiness of the Ukrainian army for all possible changes in the operational situation,” Zelenskyy said in a video.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the country's first round of "severe" economic sanctions against Moscow after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine Monday.

Moscow also voted to officially recognize the separatist-backed Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent.

“Russia’s brazen provocations are a threat to security and peace in the world,” Trudeau said in a news conference.

He said Canada will sanction members of Russia's parliament who voted to recognize the two regions as independent, Canadians will be banned from doing business there and will prohibit dealings with two state-backed Russian banks, according to Reuters. Canadians will also be prohibited from purchasing Russian sovereign debt.

"I am also authorizing the deployment of up to 460 members of the Canadian Armed Forces to Operation Reassurance. This involves more troops to Latvia, as well as the deployment of an additional frigate and maritime patrol aircraft," he said.
