The London Metals Exchange said it was halting the trading of nickel on Tuesday after “unprecedented” price increases driven by the “evolving situation in Russia and Ukraine.” As the United States considers imposing sanctions on Russia’s energy exports, some traders feared that nickel, a key component in batteries for electric vehicles and stainless steel, could be targeted as well, driving up the price by 75 percent on Monday.

The Ukrainian military claimed early Tuesday to have shot down three Russian fighter jets and a cruise missile, an assertion that was backed up by several loud explosions in the night sky over Kyiv — and a sign that its air defense systems and air force are still functioning nearly two weeks into the war.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has issued increasingly urgent pleas for Western support for his country’s air defenses. Mr. Zelensky has asked Western countries to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, an idea rebuffed by NATO because it risked direct conflict with Russia.

The United States, however, has been coordinating a possible arrangement in which Eastern European countries would send Soviet-designed fighter jets to Ukraine in exchange for American F-16s. Ukrainian pilots would not need additional training to fly the MiG aircraft, if they could be flown or trucked across the border into Ukraine.

Thick and low cloud cover over the northern parts of Ukraine in the early days of the war have limited the effectiveness of Russian bombing and air support for troops on the ground. At the same time, Russia’s armored columns have slowed, apparently bogged down by a mix of logistical glitches and Ukrainian airstrikes, artillery attacks and ambushes using anti-tank missiles.

The prospect of clearing skies, and a possible Russian shift to using air power to compensate for the lack of progress on the ground, have given new urgency to Mr. Zelensky’s requests. That Ukraine’s air force has survived for two weeks is seen by Western military analysts as something of a success.

“We will close the sky ourselves,” the Ukrainian military said in a statement Tuesday morning about the downing of the Russian planes. “NATO is invited” to help, it added.

The military had said earlier that an antiaircraft missile shot down a Russian fighter jet over Kyiv, the capital, around 8:30 p.m. on Monday. In the city center around that time, air raid sirens wailed before a series of thunderous booms in the sky.

The Ukrainian military said that about half an hour later, one of its interceptor jets shot down a Russian fighter jet in aerial combat near the capital. Air-to-air combat has been exceedingly rare in modern war, with only a tiny number of incidents in decades — between Russia and Turkey in Syria and in the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. Another Ukrainian pilot shot down a cruise missile, the statement said.

Ukrainian military statements have typically included only scant information about failures and losses in the war, leaving it unclear how many of their own planes the Russian military has shot down or destroyed on the ground. News photographs from southern Ukraine have shown blown-up and burning Ukrainian radar installations.

An effort to evacuate thousands of people from Sumy, a city east of Kyiv that has been the scene of heavy fighting, got underway on Tuesday with the dispatch of a convoy of buses, led by the Red Cross and loaded with supplies. “Today, the humanitarian corridor for Sumy should start working,” said Iryna Vereshchuk, a government minister tasked with helping displaced people. While there was hope that people could start leaving in greater numbers from that city, which had a population of around 200,000 before the war, there was little sign that a broader evacuation effort for towns and cities farther east would materialize.

The World Health Organization said that it has verified 16 attacks on health services in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, leading to nine deaths and 16 injuries. Dr. Hans Kluge, the agency’s regional director for Europe, told a virtual news conference that 76 tons of health supplies have been sent Ukraine, including five tons to Kyiv. “International collaboration for a safe humanitarian corridor for lifesaving medical supplies is a top priority,” he said.

Women fleeing the war in Ukraine are at disproportionate risk, humanitarian groups say.

As the world commemorated International Women’s Day on Tuesday, humanitarian agencies raised the alarm about the safety of women and girls fleeing the war in Ukraine.

The concern is that Ukrainian women — already unduly burdened by unpaid domestic work and the effects of the coronavirus pandemic in one of Europe’s poorest economies — are now in a staggeringly precarious position after the Russian invasion, one in which they could be more vulnerable to violence, abuse and exploitation.

So far, more than 1.7 million people have fled in what the United Nations has described as the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II. The vast majority of those rushing to safety, according to the U.N., are women and children. The world body called for “ solidarity with the women of Ukraine .”

Many of the women have left their partners, husbands, sons and brothers behind to fight against the Russian troops. Women who have been displaced are at increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence, Sima Bahous, the United Nations executive director for women, said in a statement last month.

A lack of access to health care can also put women at risk: By some estimates, about 80,000 women will give birth in the next three months in Ukraine, many of them without access to medical services.

Ukrainian women, nonetheless, have often been the face of fierce resistance against Russian aggression. They’ve prepared Molotov cocktails as weapons to fight back. They’ve taken up arms alongside Ukrainian men. They’ve confronted Russian troops and demanded they leave.

In one video that circulated widely online, a Ukrainian woman appeared to offer a Russian soldier sunflower seeds to place in his pockets so that when he died, they would grow.

They have also pleaded with Russian mothers : Do not send your sons to this war.

Amid Moscow’s tight control of information about the war and the country’s war dead, some Russian women have turned to a government-run hotline in Ukraine to get information about Russian soldiers sent to fight, according to CNN.

For this border crisis, Poles extend a warm welcome, unlike last time.

By Ada Petriczko

On the morning after Russia invaded Ukraine, Maria Hawranek did what hundreds of thousands of Poles would soon do: She signed up to host refugees at her home in Krakow.

In the evening, she got a call: A family from Lviv was on their way.

“We didn’t even discuss it,” said Ms. Hawranek, a freelance journalist whose partner, also a journalist, immediately left to cover the war. “It was obvious that we were going to do this.”

Of the 1.7 million people who have fled Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion, more than one million have made their way to Poland, according to the United Nations.

This huge, sudden influx of refugees has given rise to an enormous grassroots movement across Polish society, as private individuals have mobilized to raise funds and offer free accommodation and transport to the refugees.

More than 500,000 Poles have joined a nationwide Facebook group coordinating support. In some places, supply was greater than demand, with local authorities calling on citizens to refrain from driving to the border to offer free rides, because they were causing traffic jams.

Years of nationalist, anti-refugee policies have left Poland with a fragmented immigration system. It’s now mostly up to citizens to handle what the U.N.H.C.R. said was “the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.”

Ms. Hawranek’s guests arrived on Friday night: Kostiantyn Komkov, a software developer, Olena Poretskova, a costume designer, and their 5-year old son, Tomas. As soon as the invasion started, the family immediately left their Lviv apartment to friends who were evacuating from Kyiv, and crossed the border to Poland. “I had anticipated an attack for the past two years, and when I saw the Russian troops building at the border, I knew this was it,” Ms Poretskova said.

For Tanja Fedchyk, a nurse from Luck in western Ukraine, who has also found asylum in Poland, the decision on whether to stay or go was not instantaneous. When the Russian army first entered eastern Ukraine, she and her husband decided to wait 24 hours. “We were hoping that the situation wouldn’t develop into a full-scale invasion,” Ms. Fedchyk said. “But as hours passed, it became obvious that things were only getting worse.”

The next morning, Ms. Fedchyk and her 2-year-old son, Tymi, got in a car and headed for Wroclaw, Poland. The trip went relatively smoothly, except for a 10-hour wait at the border. But saying goodbye to their husband and father, who stayed in Luck to build barricades, left them heartbroken.

In Wroclaw, they are hosted by Robert and Hana Reisigová-Kielawski, an English language university instructor and a human-resources supervisor, who live with their two children. The couple didn’t have a spare room in the apartment so they moved their 5-year-old daughter to their bedroom.

“As we waited for their arrival, we got nervous,” Mr. Reisigová-Kielawski said. “We had no idea what physical and emotional state they would be in. I wondered how we should behave in order to be as helpful as possible, but also not overwhelm them. Which issues should we discuss and which are best left unsaid?”

One thing was clear from the beginning: They wouldn’t ask their guests how long they were planning to stay. Their invitation didn’t have an expiration date.

But whenever they asked if Ms. Fedchyk needed anything, she would say, “No, thank you. We’re just here for a few days.” As the invasion unfolded, however, it became evident that those days could turn into weeks, perhaps longer.

Since the war began, Ukrainians on both sides of the border have faced uncertainty. In Poland, the government is preparing an emergency bill that will make it easier for Ukrainians to access the labor market and some of the social benefits available to permanent residents.

Commentators have pointed out that the warm welcome Ukrainian refugees have received stands in stark contrast to the public response to the humanitarian crisis at the border with Belarus , which peaked in October. The government did not open the border to those refugees, most from the Middle East, and it banned aid workers from the border region — policies widely supported by Pol es.

The Reisigová-Kielawskis, long active in various refugee-support programs, were frustrated.

“During that crisis the government made it extremely difficult for Poles to help refugees, and unfortunately many people chose to look away,” Mr. Reisigová-Kielawski said, adding. “The grassroots movement to help Ukrainians, which we are seeing at the moment, is immense and heartwarming, but I have the impression that it is also lined with a sense of guilt that as a society we didn’t do enough back then.”

President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela signaled on Monday a willingness to increase his country’s oil production if Russian supplies are shut out of the international market, as he described a meeting with American officials over the weekend as “respectful, cordial, very diplomatic.”

Venezuela, a Russian ally whose oil industry is under American sanctions, has emerged as a possible replacement for some of the crude supplies that could be banned as the United States increases its effort to punish Russia. American officials are reportedly looking at easing the sanctions to allow Venezuelan oil back onto global markets and address rapidly rising crude prices.

But such efforts face a host of obstacles. Some members of Congress have been sharply critical of any effort to rekindle ties with Venezuela, saying that efforts to isolate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia should not boost other authoritarian leaders.

“The White House offered to abandon those seeking freedom from Venezuela in exchange for an insignificant amount of oil,” Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, said in a tweet.

Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democrat, said in a statement that resuming oil trade with Venezuela “risks perpetuating a humanitarian crisis that has destabilized Latin America and the Caribbean for an entire generation.” He called Mr. Maduro “a cancer to our hemisphere and we should not breathe new life into his reign of torture and murder.”

The United States has accused Mr. Maduro of electoral fraud, and the Trump administration attempted to oust him while recognizing the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as the country’s president in 2019. The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan oil to starve Mr. Maduro’s government of cash.

Aside from the political whiplash of resuming oil trade with Venezuela to confront what the United States sees as a more immediate challenge in Russia, there are practical problems to ramping up production as well. Venezuelan oil fields have long suffered from mismanagement, and some industry analysts say it could be slow to increase supply.

“When you’ve had a prolonged period of underinvestment, you can’t just flip a switch and bring it back overnight,” said Saul Kavonic, an energy industry analyst for Credit Suisse.

The potential cut to global supply from sanctions on Russia would also require looking far beyond Venezuela to make up the shortfall, he added.

“Literally all options are going to have to be on the table in terms of sources of alternative supply,” Mr. Kavonic said. “No one source — whether that’s Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iran, the U.S. — is going to be able in itself to come anywhere close to replacing the totality of Russian supply if all Russian exports were to be subject to sanctions.”

Diplomats and U.N. officials on Monday called for the safe passage of besieged civilians and emergency aid in Ukraine as the United Nations Security Council met to discuss the worsening humanitarian crisis there.

The officials spoke of ordinary people trapped without food and water, of hospitals running out of essential medicine, of women and children being gunned down as they fled, and of aid workers struggling to reach and operate safely in the cities and towns where battles raged.

U.N. officials delivered stark numbers: In just 11 days, 1.7 million refugees, half of them children, have crossed into neighboring countries. There have been 1,207 civilian casualties in Ukraine, with 406 dead. That includes 27 children killed and 42 children injured, and “countless more have been severely traumatized.” About 100,000 children, half of them with disabilities, are living in institutions and boarding schools that are at risk.

Beyond Ukraine, the conflict is reverberating as food prices increase and supplies grow uncertain, especially in places like Yemen and Lebanon and some parts of Africa, said Martin Griffiths, the U.N.’s top envoy for emergency humanitarian aid.

Mr. Griffiths said that even as U.N. and other aid agencies had scaled up their operations and received more money from donors, their efforts had been outpaced by the rapidly growing scope of the crisis and the fluid security situation.

“Make no mistake, we are unable to meet the needs of civilians today,” Mr. Griffiths said. “I hope we don’t fail them tomorrow.”

The U.N. has also deployed a small team to Moscow to mediate a de-escalation of the conflict and to facilitate humanitarian operations, said Stéphane Dujarric, a U.N. spokesman.

The team in Moscow has met with officials from Russia’s ministries of defense and foreign affairs, asking for safe and secure humanitarian operations and the movement of civilians and U.N. staff, Mr. Dujarric said.

Catherine M. Russell, the executive director of UNICEF, focused on the conflict’s impact on 7.5 million Ukrainian children. She said schools, orphanages, homes and hospitals had all come under attack. Children were living without electricity and water and in bunkers and shelters.

“What is happening to children in Ukraine is a moral outrage,” Ms. Russell said, adding that images of a mother and her two children lying dead on the street must shock the world. “We must act to protect children from this brutality.”

The U.S. and its allies condemned Russia and called on it to facilitate and honor humanitarian corridors and allow Ukrainian civilians safe passage to all borders.

Russia had offered Ukrainians a safe passageway only to Russia or Belarus — an offer that was rejected.

“We need Russia’s firm, clear, public and unequivocal commitment to allow and facilitate immediate, unhindered humanitarian access for humanitarian partners in Ukraine,” said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the American ambassador to the United Nations.

Russia’s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, continued to deny, as he had done in previous Council meetings, that his country’s troops had targeted civilians and impeded their escape. He once again blamed Ukrainian forces for targeting women and children and forcing civilians to stay in cities as human shields.

“Safety for civilians is not a problem for Russia; we are not bombarding them but rather Ukrainian criminals and neo-Nazis are making use of citizens as human shields,” said Mr. Nebenzya.

Ukraine’s ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, accused the Russian ambassador of spreading disinformation. “It’s very difficult after these meetings to listen to the persistent lies and delusions and delirium from the representative of this country,” he said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine spoke from his office in Kyiv on Monday night, showing that he remains in the capital despite the Russian invasion that began on Feb. 24.

In a brief video posted on his Facebook page, Mr. Zelensky said that he was not hiding, and he was not afraid of anyone.

“We used to say: Monday is a hard day,” he said. “There is a war in the country so every day is Monday, and now we are used to the fact that every day and every night are like that.”

In the video, Mr. Zelensky provided updates on Russian attacks, and also said he had signed a decree on Monday to present state awards to 96 “Ukrainian heroes.”

Mr. Zelensky also criticized Russian troops for attacks on certain sites on Monday, including accusing them of firing at a bread factory in Makariv, about an hour west of Kyiv.

“Think about it — to fire at the bread factory. Who should you be to do that?” Mr. Zelensky said.

The president also condemned Russian troops for disregarding an agreement on a humanitarian corridor, after shelling prevented evacuation of besieged cities.

“Did it work?” Mr. Zelensky said of the corridor. “Russian tanks worked instead.”

In an update on Monday night, Britain’s defense ministry said that Russian troops continued to directly target evacuation corridors, which had resulted in several casualties of civilians who tried to flee Irpin, just outside Kyiv. It said the town had been without heat, water or power for several days because of fighting in the area.

Mr. Zelensky’s nightly video addresses, rallying Ukrainian resistance and world opinion, have become something of a ritual since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. Russian offensives against several major cities have bogged down in the face of logistical problems and unexpectedly fierce defenses.

In his Monday night message, Mr. Zelensky said that a national movement had unfolded in the southern part of the country, creating “a nightmare” for Russia.

“We are not afraid of tanks and machine guns,” he said.

Mr. Zelensky said that every day of resistance puts Ukraine in a “strong position” to guarantee the country’s future, adding that Ukraine will rebuild everything that has been shelled and bombed by Russian forces.

“There will be no trace of the enemy,” he said. “We will make our cities destroyed by the invader better than any city in Russia.”

Hate for Putin and ordinary Russians consumes Ukraine.

LVIV, Ukraine — Trapped in his apartment on the outskirts of Kyiv during fierce battles over the weekend, the well-known Ukrainian poet Oleksandr Irvanets composed a few lines that encapsulated the national mood.

“I shout out to the whole world,” he wrote in a short poem published online by his fans, who have since lost touch with the writer and were worried that he may have fallen behind Russian lines. “I won’t forgive anyone!”

If there is one overriding emotion gripping Ukraine right now, it is hate.

It is a deep, seething bitterness for President Vladimir V. Putin , his military and his government. But Ukrainians are not giving a pass to ordinary Russians, either, calling them complicit through years of political passivity. The hatred is vented by mothers in bomb shelters, by volunteers preparing to fight on the front lines, by intellectuals and by artists.

The emotion is so powerful it could not be assuaged even by an Orthodox religious holiday on Sunday intended to foster forgiveness before Lent. Called Forgiveness Sunday, the holiday is recognized in both the Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox churches .

And this hatred has overwhelmed the close personal ties between two Slavic nations, where many people have family living in both countries .

Billboards have gone up along roadsides in gigantic block letters, telling Russians in profanity-laced language to get out. Social media posts in spaces often shared by Russians and Ukrainians have been awash in furious comments.

Some Ukrainians have posted pictures of people killed in the military assault in Russian chat rooms on the Telegram app. They have vented by writing on the reviews pages for websites of Moscow restaurants.

And they have been mocking Russians in scathing terms for complaining about hardships with banking transactions or the collapsing ruble currency because of international sanctions.

“Damn, what’s wrong with Apple Pay?” Stanislav Bobrytsky, a Ukrainian computer programmer also trapped in the fighting around the capital, Kyiv, wrote sarcastically about how Russians are responding to the war. “I cannot pay for a latte in my favorite coffee shop.”

Mr. Putin is the target of much of the Ukrainians’ unbridled resentment.

The authoritarian leader is to blame, almost all Ukrainians agree. But the frustration is also directed more broadly at Russian society.

Once victims in southeast Europe, Jews come to the aid of fleeing Ukrainians.
Laetitia Vancon for The New York Times

CHISINAU, Moldova — At a synagogue in central Chisinau on Monday, an Israeli social worker, Omer Hod, had a flash of historical vertigo. Ms. Hod’s ancestors had lived in Chisinau more than a century ago, surviving a devastating pogrom in 1903 before emigrating to what became Israel. Now their descendant had returned to the Moldovan capital — this time not as a victim, but as a rescuer.

“It’s like closure for me,” said Ms. Hod, a 26-year-old from Jerusalem who had come to Chisinau to help with the evacuation to Israel of thousands of Jewish refugees from Ukraine.

“Back then, it was almost a shame to be Jewish,” Ms. Hod said. “Now, people want to show they are Jewish so that they can be evacuated.”

Today, as in the early 1900s, Jews are once again escaping violence in southeast Europe. But the context is radically different — cathartically so for the many Israelis who have come here to join the relief effort.

A century ago, Jews fled widespread antisemitic attacks in cities like Chisinau and Odessa — pogroms that helped spur early Zionists to emigrate independently to Palestine. Today, the violence is not antisemitic. And this time around, representatives of the Jewish state, as well as an unusually high number of independent Israeli aid organizations, are now waiting at Ukraine’s borders to shepherd Ukrainian Jews to Israel.

LVIV, Ukraine — Russian and Ukrainian negotiators said Monday that there would be another attempt made to open safe corridors for civilians to leave Ukrainian cities under attack, though they reported no progress on ending the war.

There were “some positive results in terms of logistics of humanitarian corridors,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, after three hours of talks in Belarus.

The Kremlin’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said the corridors should be functional by Tuesday. Russia’s defense ministry said safe routes for civilians would be opened to leave Kyiv, the capital, in the north; the port city of Mariupol, in the southeast; and the heavily bombarded city of Kharkiv and the Sumy region in the northeast.

The negotiating session was the third that the two countries’ representatives have held since the war began on Feb. 24, with little to show for it, despite previous agreements to let civilians safely leave besieged areas.

Attempts to evacuate civilians in areas of the country under heavy attack collapsed over the weekend amid shelling and mortar attacks. Ukrainian officials have accused Russians of violating agreements and intentionally targeting escape routes.

Mr. Podolyak said that if the corridors hold, Ukraine would be able to provide “more effective assistance for people who are currently suffering from Russian aggression.”

In a statement on Twitter, he said “intensive consultations” to reach a consensus on a possible cease-fire and an end to hostilities would continue.

The Kremlin has demanded the recognition of two breakaway enclaves in southeastern Ukraine as independent nations, and of Moscow’s sovereignty over the Crimean peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine and annexed in 2014. It also demands that Ukraine pledge military neutrality.

David Arakhamia, the parliamentary faction leader from Ukraine’s ruling party, said in an interview on Sunday with Fox News that Ukraine’s territorial integrity was not on the table, and that such recognition would be “unacceptable” to society.

The letter ‘Z’ has become a symbol for Russians who support the invasion of Ukraine.

The “Z” first drew attention several weeks ago when it was painted a couple feet high on the sides of the thousands of tanks, armored personnel carriers and other military vehicles mustering along the Russian border with Ukraine.

In Russia, the letter then began to pop up all over the place. There are Z stickers on the backs of cars and commercial vehicles, and one talk show pundit recently appeared wearing a T-shirt with a large white Z on it.

Some corporate logos and newspaper names that contained a Z manipulated the letter to highlight it. An advertising campaign using billboards in large cities featured a large Z created out of a black and orange ribbon, the St. George ribbon, which is a symbol of the Russian military.

It is not uncommon for vehicles dedicated to a military campaign to display a readily identifiable mark — U.S. Army vehicles used to repulse the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait were painted with a big white chevron, for example. To see it spread among civilians is another matter.

The campaign’s ubiquity led many to conclude that it was an orchestrated Kremlin effort to drum up support for the war, not least because it resembled so many previous efforts. It came with a hashtag with echoes of past wars: “We don’t abandon our own.” (As in soldiers.)

“This is definitely a state-induced meme,” said Vasily Gatov, a Russian-American media analyst based in Boston. “There are always people receptive to this kind of message.” He noted that there was a small army of propagandists paid to spread the meme on social media to give it the false appearance of popularity.

The fact that some of the usual suspects lined up added to the sense of government coordination.

Maria Butina was deported from the United States in 2019 after being sent to prison for working as an unregistered agent for Russia. Now a member of the State Duma , or Parliament, she posted a video of herself drawing a white Z on the lapel of her suit jacket.

“Do your work, brothers,” she said in an apparent reference to the Russian troops in Ukraine. “We will always support you.”

The state-run RT television network also spread the symbol.

Another video online showed what looked like a youth flash mob in a factory or meeting hall, wearing black T-shirts with a Z and dancing in formation amid a sea of Russian flags. Similar videos have cropped up during previous Kremlin campaigns, the only difference being the addition of the T-shirts.

Critics on social media did not miss the opportunity to point out that Hitler mobilized thousands of black-shirted supporters, as well, and some manipulated the letter Z to make it resemble the Nazi swastika.

No doubt some of the displays reflected genuine support. On Saturday, for example, the Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak wore a Z on his uniform at a competition in Qatar that also included Ukrainian gymnasts. The Russian head coach and some fellow Russian gymnasts publicly defended him, even as the sport’s international governing body opened a disciplinary proceeding.

The symbol has also been deployed as a threat: Anton Dolin, a prominent film critic who left Russia over his opposition to the war, posted a picture on Facebook of a giant white Z that someone had spray-painted on his apartment door, which he called an effort at intimidation.

Oddly for a nationalist symbol, the Z being used is the version from the Latin alphabet. The Russian version, from the Cyrillic alphabet, is more rounded, like a 3.

After weeks of speculation about what it meant, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday that it came from the preposition “Za,” the first word in the Russian phrase “Za pobedu,” or “For victory.”

That explanation seemed to have provoked a sharp exchange on Monday in the United Nations Security Council, where the Ukrainian ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said that the “Z” actually stood for “zveri,” which means beasts or animals in Russian. His Russian counterpart, Vasily Nebenzya, shot back that the Russians had their own opinion of who the animals were.

Baltics leaders, alarmed for years by Russia, tell Blinken the West needs to be tougher with Moscow.

VILNIUS, Lithuania — Demanding assurances that the Baltic States will not become Russia’s next battleground, Lithuania’s president firmly told America’s top diplomat on Monday that warnings to deter Moscow from further aggressions are “no longer enough.”

Hours later, Latvia’s foreign minister dismally predicted that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would shatter any belief that the region could ever let down its guard against President Vladimir V. Putin. “We have no illusions about Putin’s Russia anymore,” Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said. “I don’t see any good reason to assume Russia might change its policy.”

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is likely to get a similar earful on Tuesday in Estonia as he tries to convince Baltic leaders, who are also part of NATO, that the United States is doing all it can to stop Russia’s assault on Ukraine from spreading across Europe — while remaining careful not to set off a wider war.

In a region that borders Russia, and which all too well remembers the forced rule of the Soviet Union, the Baltics are warily watching the crisis in Ukraine as a bellwether for their own security. Ukrainian flags are hung from doorways and draped from balconies across the capitals of Lithuania and Latvia. Blue-and-yellow posters, lights and billboards broadcast the region’s support for Ukraine. In Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, a commuter bus had replaced its digital route display on Monday with a message that read, simply, “Vilnius 🤍 Ukraina.”

In Riga, the Latvian capital, Mr. Blinken said it was “very moving” to see the outpouring of support for Ukraine in the Baltics, which he praised as a longtime “democratic wall” against authoritarian rule.

But Baltic leaders appear unsatisfied with the level of military support the United States is providing to help deter Russian advances, either to Ukraine directly or to its allies in Europe. Mr. Rinkevics also said international sanctions against Mr. Putin’s allies could be toughened, and he called on European states to stop the oil and gas imports from Russia that have become Moscow’s economic lifeline.

Russia provides 10 percent of the world’s oil and more than a third of the European Union’s natural gas. Western sanctions are largely engineered to allow companies in Europe to continue to buy Russian energy, and the White House has resisted more aggressive penalties for fear that they would drive up the price of gasoline and other energy costs for Americans.

Europe, Baltic leaders told Mr. Blinken, has entered a new chapter.

“Unfortunately, the worsening security situation through the Baltic region is of great concern for all of us and around the world,” said President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania. “Russia’s reckless aggression against Ukraine once again proves that it is a long-term threat to European security, the security of our alliance, no matter how the end of the war in Ukraine comes.”

He added: “I must say that strengthening deterrence is no longer enough, and we need more defense here in place. Otherwise, it will be too late here, Mr. Secretary. Putin will not stop in Ukraine if he will not be stopped.”

Mr. Blinken sought to reassure the officials that, as fellow members of NATO, the Baltic States would be robustly defended should Russia try to move in.

Citing the NATO collective defense pact that “an attack on one is an attack on all,” Mr. Blinken said the United States and the rest of the military alliance “will defend every, every inch of NATO territory should it come under attack.”

“There should be no doubt about that on anyone’s mind,” Mr. Blinken said.

It was a message he repeated throughout the day.

There are already thousands of American troops in the Baltics, the majority of which were sent in the face of Russia’s recent aggressions, and Mr. Blinken noted that the Pentagon has sent F-35 fighter jets as it considers a more permanent presence of U.S. forces to the region.

At the same time, the United States and other NATO states have rushed more than 17,000 antitank weapons , including Javelin missiles, to Ukraine in an effort to help the besieged country defend itself from Russia’s far more powerful military. Mr. Blinken said an estimated 70 percent of assistance provided by the United States is already in Ukraine’s hands.

Though Ukraine’s leaders have pleaded for NATO to establish a no-fly zone over its skies — a demand that the country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, delivered to Mr. Blinken this past weekend at Ukraine’s border with Poland — neither the United States nor the rest of the military alliance is willing to take that step, worried that it would escalate a conflict that has already created the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

Mr. Blinken also sidestepped a question on Monday as to whether Poland would provide its fighter planes to Ukraine after being equipped with American F-16 jets, although he said earlier this week that the deal was being considered.

Whether it can go though quickly enough to stanch the bloodshed in Ukraine, where Russian shelling has killed civilians and millions of people have been left homeless, is not yet clear.

What is more obvious is how heavily the casualties are weighing on the Baltics.

“We cannot afford for Ukrainian cities to become another Srebrenica, Grozny, or Aleppo,” said Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister.

UNICEF’s executive director, Catherine Russell, told the U.N. Security Council that, since the conflict in Ukraine began, at least 27 children have been killed and 42 have been injured. She said half of the 1.7 million refugees fleeing Ukraine were children. “So many children have been deeply traumatized,” Russell said.

Ukraine says it shot down two Russian airplanes over Kyiv.

Ukrainian jets and an antiaircraft missile shot down two Russian airplanes over the city of Kyiv and in a nearby area, the commander of the Ukrainian military said in a statement on Monday evening.

Several large explosions were heard in central Kyiv after an air-raid siren sounded, but it was not immediately possible to confirm the downing of Russian airplanes.

Western governments have said Ukraine’s air defense systems are still operating 12 days into the war and that most of its air force is intact. Valery Zaluzhny, the Ukrainian Army commander, said one Russian plane was shot down over the city at 8:30 p.m. and that a second was shot down in aerial combat near the capital.

Russia wants to recruit Syrian fighters to help it in Ukraine, the Pentagon says.

WASHINGTON — Russia is trying to recruit Syrian fighters to join its forces in Ukraine, a sign that the Kremlin is frustrated with the pace and scope of operations in its invasion, a Pentagon spokesman, John F. Kirby, said on Monday.

American analysts do not have any details on the number of Syrian recruits; where they are in Syria; how they are being trained, if at all, by the Russians; or whether any have actually traveled yet to Ukraine, Mr. Kirby said.

He sought to portray the recruiting effort, reported on Sunday night by The Wall Street Journal , as an indicator of how desperate Russia is to reverse its stalled offensive across most of the country’s north, including on Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, the nation’s second-largest city, which has come under intensifying Russian missile and artillery bombardment.

“I cannot get inside, you know, Mr. Putin’s brain as to why he would find it necessary to seek support from foreign fighters,” Mr. Kirby told reporters at the Pentagon.

Russia has deployed into Ukraine virtually all of the more than 150,000 troops that had assembled on the country’s borders.

If Syrian fighters join in, they would add to the steady flow of foreigners streaming into Ukraine on both sides of the conflict.

Some of the Syrians have experience in urban combat, which could be the next phase of operations in Ukraine.

Even before the invasion began on Feb. 24, Russian mercenaries with experience fighting in Syria and Libya were covertly trickling into two rebel territories in eastern Ukraine, helping to lay the groundwork for war, according to two senior European security officials.

The mercenaries, who number about 300, are with the Russian paramilitary group Wagner and arrived in the separatist enclaves of Donetsk and Luhansk wearing civilian clothes, according to the European officials.

President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia loves judo.

His enthusiasm for the sport even extended to body-slamming opponents in an instructional video in 2008. As recently as 2019, he was filmed throwing Olympic judokas in a training session. Such footage is of a piece with his well-known bare-chested fishing and horseback riding clips.

This love of judo helped pave the way for Mr. Putin’s appointment in 2008 to the position of honorary president of the International Judo Federation.

But shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, the federation suspended Mr. Putin from that position. And on Monday, in a one-sentence news release, it said he had formally “been removed from all positions held in the International Judo Federation.”
