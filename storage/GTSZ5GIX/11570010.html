 particular, ABC News has learned that Russian leader Vladimir Putin had
 told his military forces to be ready to go by Wednesday, Feb. 16, but 
it is still unclear whether he has made a decision to attack his 
neighbor.<br><br>The Russian government has denied any plans to invade 
Ukraine and repeatedly accused the U.S. of "hysteria" with these 
increasingly urgent warnings about one.<br><br>"After Russian troops 
finish drills and return to barracks, the West will declare 'diplomatic 
victory' by having 'secured' Russian 'de-escalation' -- a predictable 
scenario and cheap domestic political points," Russian Foreign Minister 
Sergei Lavrov said Saturday, according to the country's foreign 
ministry.<br><br>The U.S. believes an invasion would likely begin with 
electronic warfare and aerial bombardment against critical 
infrastructure, the sources said, followed by special operations forces 
entering Kyiv to decapitate the Ukrainian government and resupplying 
troops entering from Belarus -- with plans to complete their operations 
in 24 to 72 hours.<br><br>During his remarks Tuesday, Biden confirmed 
that Russian troops "remain very much in a threatening position" -- 
warning that an invasion remains "distinctly possible" and would inflict
 an "enormous" human toll.<br><br><b>FULL SPEECH: Biden says Russian troops remain in 'threatening position'</b> <div class="shortcode-container"><div class="shortcode-video"><div itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="name" content="Biden says US ready to 'give the diplomacy every chance to succeed' to defuse Russia-Ukraine crisis"><meta itemprop="description" content="President Joe Biden made an appeal for diplomacy to continue as the world watches to see if Vladimir Putin orders an invasion of Ukraine."><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/11567671_021522-cc-ap-biden-remarks-tues-img.jpg"><meta itemprop="contentURL" content="https://content.uplynk.com/ext/86878e7b71a34599b6cfa3d4a5bb31cf/021522-cc-spev-biden-ukraine-remarks-vid.m3u8?ad._v=2&amp;ad.preroll=1&amp;ad.fill_slate=1&amp;ad.ametr=1&amp;rays=ihgfedc"><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2022-02-15T20:51:20Z"><div class="video-player-default"><div class="otv-vpaid"><div class="vpaid-content"></div><video class="vpaid-video"></video></div><div class="video-poster" data-autostart="false" data-rsid="wdgotvwlsresponsive,wdgotvsecondaryresponsive" data-pagename="politics/post_video/some-russian-troops-moved-to-firing-positions-near-ukraine,-putin-said-be-ready-by-feb.-16:-sources=11570010" data-topic="u.s. &amp; world" data-contenttype="post" data-channel="misc" data-content-id="11570010" data-display-date="1645017068" data-adunit="/wls/abc7chicago.com/web/politics" data-tag="nato,vladimir-putin,russia,ukraine,government,joe-biden,us-world,politics" data-url="https://content.uplynk.com/ext/86878e7b71a34599b6cfa3d4a5bb31cf/021522-cc-spev-biden-ukraine-remarks-vid.m3u8?ad._v=2&amp;ad.preroll=1&amp;ad.fill_slate=1&amp;ad.ametr=1&amp;rays=ihgfedc" data-islive="false" data-isclone="false" data-imgsrc="https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/11567671_021522-cc-ap-biden-remarks-tues-img.jpg" data-dynamic="https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/11567671_021522-cc-ap-biden-remarks-tues-img.jpg" data-imgalt="" data-video-id="11567673" data-station="wls" data-headline="Biden says US ready to 'give the diplomacy every chance to succeed' to defuse Russia-Ukraine crisis" data-caption="President Joe Biden made an appeal for diplomacy to continue as the world watches to see if Vladimir Putin orders an invasion of Ukraine."></div></div></div><div class="meta image-caption global-caption"><a class="button button-block embed-btn" href="#">EMBED </a><a class="button button-block" href="https://abc7chicago.com/video/">More News Videos<div class="arrow-blue arrow-pos-right"></div></a><div class="embed-code"><textarea class="textarea" onclick="this.focus();this.select()">&lt;iframe

Biden made an appeal for diplomacy to continue as the world watches to

 Biden said the U.S. would welcome Moscow pulling back its forces and 
engaging in diplomatic talks on U.S. and NATO proposals, on issues like 
arms control and transparency over military exercises.<br><div class="adRectangle-pos-small-inline" data-set="adAppend"></div><br>While
 Lavrov said Moscow's response to those proposals would be transmitted 
in the coming days, Putin said that Russia's key demands were being 
ignored -- that Ukraine be barred from joining NATO and that the Western
 military alliance pull back its forces from Eastern European member 
states.<br><br>The U.S. and NATO have said those are nonstarters -- 
issues that only the alliance itself or individual countries can decide 
and not under Russian pressure.<br><br>"This is about more than just 
Russia and Ukraine. It's about standing for what we believe in, for the 
future that we want for our world, for liberty -- for liberty, the right
 of countless countries to choose their own destiny, and the right of 
people to determine their own futures, or the principle that a country 
can't change its neighbor's borders by force," Biden said at the White 
House.<br><br>Biden and Putin spoke Saturday -- their first conversation
 in over a month -- while their top diplomats Lavrov and Secretary of 
State Antony Blinken have spoken twice now in recent days. While the 
door to continued dialogue remains open, both sides have indicated, 
there are concerns Russia may resort to war even as it negotiates.<br><br>Russia
 already seized Ukrainian territory when it annexed Crimea in 2014, and 
since then, it has fomented a war against Ukrainian troops by arming and
 financing separatists in Ukraine's eastern provinces known as Donbas. 
Russian parliament passed a resolution Tuesday calling on Putin to 
recognize them as independent republics -- something Putin indicated he 
would not yet do.<br><br><div class="shortcode-container"><div class="shortcode-video"><div itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="name" content="Foreign policy expert discusses Russia-Ukraine crisis"><meta itemprop="description" content="Paul Poast, a nonresident fellow on foreign policy and public opinion at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, discusses the Russia-Ukraine crisis."><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/11568620_021522-wls-foreign-policy-guest-7p-vid.jpg"><meta itemprop="contentURL" content="https://content.uplynk.com/ext/aac37e2c66614e699fb189ab391084ff/021522-wls-foreign-policy-guest-7p-vid.m3u8?ad._v=2&amp;ad.preroll=1&amp;ad.fill_slate=1&amp;ad.ametr=1&amp;rays=ihgfedc"><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2022-02-16T02:19:28Z"><div class="video-player-default"><div class="otv-vpaid"><div class="vpaid-content"></div><video class="vpaid-video"></video></div><div class="video-poster" data-autostart="false" data-rsid="wdgotvwlsresponsive,wdgotvsecondaryresponsive" data-pagename="politics/post_video/some-russian-troops-moved-to-firing-positions-near-ukraine,-putin-said-be-ready-by-feb.-16:-sources=11570010" data-topic="u.s. &amp; world" data-contenttype="post" data-channel="misc" data-content-id="11570010" data-display-date="1645017068" data-adunit="/wls/abc7chicago.com/web/politics" data-tag="nato,vladimir-putin,russia,ukraine,government,joe-biden,us-world,politics" data-url="https://content.uplynk.com/ext/aac37e2c66614e699fb189ab391084ff/021522-wls-foreign-policy-guest-7p-vid.m3u8?ad._v=2&amp;ad.preroll=1&amp;ad.fill_slate=1&amp;ad.ametr=1&amp;rays=ihgfedc" data-islive="false" data-isclone="false" data-imgsrc="https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/11568620_021522-wls-foreign-policy-guest-7p-vid.jpg" data-dynamic="https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/11568620_021522-wls-foreign-policy-guest-7p-vid.jpg" data-imgalt="" data-video-id="11568621" data-station="wls" data-headline="Foreign policy expert discusses Russia-Ukraine crisis" data-caption="Paul Poast, a nonresident fellow on foreign policy and public opinion at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, discusses the Russia-Ukraine crisis."></div></div></div><div class="meta image-caption global-caption"><a class="button button-block embed-btn" href="#">EMBED </a><a class="button button-block" href="https://abc7chicago.com/video/">More News Videos<div class="arrow-blue arrow-pos-right"></div></a><div class="embed-code"><textarea class="textarea" onclick="this.focus();this.select()">&lt;iframe

 sources said if Russia attacks Ukraine, it would likely not be against a
 small slice of territory in Donbas, but a bloody, brutal, and swift 
campaign to topple President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration and 
install a puppet government.<br><br>Amid the heightened U.S. fears, the 
U.S. has also been concerned that the Zelenskyy's government hasn't 
responded quickly enough and isn't better prepared for a potential 
Russian invasion, sources said, including the positioning of its forces 
in eastern Ukraine.<br><br>U.S. officials have been urging better 
preparedness for two months now, the sources added, but President 
Zelenskyy and his inner circle have been both intent on staving off a 
panic and persistent in a belief that Moscow wouldn't invade.<br><div class="adRectangle-pos-small-inline" data-set="adAppend"></div><br>While
 some U.S. officials doubt Putin is bluffing given the costs, financial 
and political, of the buildup, many analysts have been skeptical of dire
 U.S. assessments -- with some saying Putin is achieving his ultimate 
objective: destabilizing an increasingly democratic Ukraine aligned with
 the West.<br><br>"Putin has the hard experience of humiliation in 
Chechnya that tells him that while Russia might eventually be able to 
conquer Ukraine, they can't hold it, and with any crossing of the border
 they will pay a very high price in blood and treasure," said retired 
Col. Stephen Ganyard, a former senior State Department official and now 
an ABC News contributor. "If he fails in Ukraine, it could be his rule 
that ends as well."<br><br>In particular, Ganyard said, a Russian 
invasion is still facing warm, wet weather conditions that make tank 
movements and aerial bombardment difficult, while the number of massed 
Russian troops still pales compared to Ukraine's forces, especially if 
Russian troops have to occupy a country the size of Texas.<br><br>Biden 
made clear the U.S. still hopes for a diplomatic off-ramp and for Putin 
to decide against invasion, even as they continue to make preparations 
for one -- from increased military aid for Ukraine, to coordination with
 European allies and others on sanctions.<br><br>Since Russia's buildup 
began, allies and partners have come together quickly to prepare a 
year's worth of sanctions work in the last six weeks, sources said, 
including export controls that could devastate Russia's economy.<br><br>But
 the U.S. is concerned that Russia could maintain its troop buildup and 
other ways of pressuring Ukraine short of taking military action -- and 
that that could start to splinter the Western coalition's unity.<br><br>Biden
 made reference to the economic pain that could be felt at home in the 
U.S., including elevated energy prices because of Russia's major role as
 an oil and gas exporter.<br><br>"But the American people understand 
that defending democracy and liberty is never without cost," Biden said 
-- adding his administration was taking "active steps to alleviate the 
pressure on our own energy markets."<br><br><i>ABC News's Luis Martinez, Matt Seyler, Ben Gittleson, and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.</i> <div class="report-typo">
