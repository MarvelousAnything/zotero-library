The southern Ukrainian city of Odessa was on Monday bracing for a Russian assault as humanitarian conditions across the country continued to deteriorate under Moscow’s increased shelling of civilian areas.

The mayor of the strategically important port city told The Washington Post that “the aggressor is not far from Odessa,” with the Kremlin’s forces having already captured the city of Kherson to the east and eight Russian warships looming just outside Ukraine’s territorial waters.

Concern mounted as the third round of talks between the two sides ended without a breakthrough. Ukrainian officials said Russia pressed them to give up Crimea and territory in eastern Ukraine as a condition for halting the invasion. However, Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said they made some progress on organizing local cease-fires and evacuation corridors for women, children and other civilians, who have increasingly come under attack with Russia stepping up indiscriminate shelling.

Here’s what to know

    Oil prices reached their highest point in more than a decade on Monday, as the possibility of further disruption to energy markets spurred a global stock market sell-off .
    Moscow’s proposed evacuation routes to Russia and Belarus are “unacceptable,” Ukraine said after Russia announced six thoroughfares — four of which led to the two nations.
    At least 27 children have been killed and 42 wounded, UNICEF said. The United Nation says 406 civilians have been killed in the Russian invasion, adding that the actual toll is likely much higher.
    The Pentagon will send an additional 500 U.S. troops from the United States to Europe to bolster American forces in the eastern part of the continent, a senior U.S. defense official said.
    Russia did not show up for a hearing at the United Nations’ top court, effectively boycotting Ukrainian efforts to seek an immediate end to the fighting.

Twitch streamers in Russia lose livelihoods as sanctions hit home

Since the United States and European Union began levying economic sanctions against Russia, major platforms, services and payment processors have opted to block transactions to the country. Over the weekend, the live-streaming platform Twitch told Russian streamers that it too will be adhering to sanctions and withholding payments for the foreseeable future.

Twitch informed affected Russian streamers of its plans via email . (Twitch is owned by Amazon, whose founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.)

“Payouts to the financial institution associated with your Twitch account have been blocked as a result of sanctions,” read the email. “Twitch complies with economic sanctions imposed by the United States and other governments, and is complying with those imposed in response to the situation in Ukraine. These sanctions may limit or impact your access to payouts, ability to monetize your stream, and/or financially support other creators.”

The email from Twitch went on to add that “we appreciate how frustrating and difficult this is and would like to reassure you that if you can’t provide an alternative financial institution, we will do our best to pay you revenue you have earned as soon as we are permitted to do so.”

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to derail Iran nuclear talks

VIENNA — Fears mounted Monday that the Iran nuclear deal may become collateral damage in the Ukraine war as Russia pressed its demand to be exempted from U.S. sanctions in any future business dealings with Iran.

Negotiators had hoped to finalize an agreement to revive the 2015 nuclear deal imminently and have already allowed several presumed deadlines to slip after 11 months of talks on ways to bring the deal back to life.

The talks have been focused on how to bring both the United States and Iran back into compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA as the deal is known, by rolling back sanctions imposed by the United States after it pulled out of the agreement in 2018 and the advances later made by Iran in its nuclear program in response to the U.S. sanctions.

The eruption of war in Ukraine has thrown up additional complications by overturning Russia’s relations with the Western nations involved in the negotiations, including the United States, Britain, France and Germany, along with Iran and China. Because the United States withdrew from the agreement, the talks at the Palais Coburg Hotel in Vienna have been taking place among the remaining parties, with negotiators shuttling between the talks and the U.S. delegation at a different hotel.

In appearances from presidential office in Kyiv, Zelensky says Russian forces are ‘all war criminals’

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky remained defiant on Monday in a pair of videos recorded at the leader’s Kyiv offices — the first time he has publicly appeared there since the invasion began — where he declared that his outgunned army “will endure” and said everyone involved in the Russian assault should be considered a war criminal.

In a video address posted to his Facebook page , Zelensky gave Ukrainians — who have relied on his nightly posts for updates and morale boosts — a tour of the presidential office and a view from the window.

“I’m not hiding,” he said. “And I’m not afraid of anyone.”

Hours later, ABC News aired a prerecorded interview between Zelensky and journalist David Muir in which the Ukrainian president addressed reports that Russia has intentionally targeted civilians. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said such actions would constitute a war crime.

“I think that all people who came to our land, all people who gave those orders, all soldiers who were shooting, they’re all war criminals,” Zelensky said.

Asked whether he believed that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been targeting unarmed women, children and others, Zelensky replied: “Why would I care? The result is the same. People are dying.”

Schools have been bombed, he said — both kindergartens and universities. He also spoke of the panic last week at a nuclear power plant, where a projectile started a fire. The shelling, he said, has escalated.

“We are being bombarded not only in the city of Kyiv, not only in the housing sectors, but also in the suburbs of Kyiv,” he said. “You can’t even recognize the way our capital looks right now.”

Zelensky acknowledged that his fighters faced long odds.

“The problem is that for one soldier of Ukraine, we have 10 Russian soldiers, and for every one Ukrainian tank, we have 50 Russian tanks,” he said, before adding: “We will endure. Even if they come into all of our cities, there will be insurgencies.”

Zelensky defended his calls for a no-fly zone over Ukraine and appealed for further U.S. support, particularly in providing his military with more fighter jets. He pitched the conflict as pivotal in deciding the battle between liberal democracy and authoritarianism.

“When the limits of rights and freedoms are being violated and stepped on,” he said, “then you have to protect us because we will come first and you will come second.”

Australia announces new sanctions, targets Russian propaganda, disinformation

SYDNEY — Australia announced Tuesday that it is placing new sanctions on people it described as “Moscow’s propagandists and purveyors of disinformation,” who officials said are trying to legitimatize Russia’s unprovoked invasion with false narratives such as the “de-Nazification” of Ukraine.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been accompanied by a widespread disinformation campaign, both within Russia and internationally. A new law signed Friday by Russian President Vladimir Putin bans what the country calls “fake” news about its military, including language that describes Russia’s attack against Ukraine as an “invasion,” under threat of a 15-year prison sentence.

“Tragically for Russia, President Putin has shut down independent voices and locked everyday Russians into a world characterised by lies and disinformation,” Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement Tuesday, as she unveiled the new sanctions. “The addition of sanctions on those responsible for this insidious tactic recognises the powerful impact that disinformation and propaganda can have in conflict.”

The Australian government is sanctioning 10 people for their role in encouraging hostility toward Ukraine and promoting pro-Kremlin propaganda to legitimize the invasion. It is also working with social media companies including Facebook, Twitter and Google to suspend content generated by Russian state media in Australia. Local television networks SBS and Foxtel have already announced the suspension of Russia Today and NTV broadcasting.

The additional sanctions also target Russia’s armed forces, with financial sanctions and travel bans against six senior military commanders responsible for implementing ground, naval and air attacks on Ukraine.

The latest round of sanctions comes after Australia enacted financial sanctions on institutions of economic significance to Russia, including the Central Bank of Russia, last week.

Russian oligarchs have donated millions to U.S. charities, museums and universities, analysis shows

American philanthropies, museums and universities have accepted millions of dollars from tycoons aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin, including several who are the targets of Western sanctions, according to an analysis by anti-corruption researchers.

Among the many beneficiaries are such storied institutions as New York’s Museum of Modern Art, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Mayo Clinic and the Guggenheim Museum, the research shows — a reflection of how deeply money from Russian oligarchs has penetrated American society.

The findings are likely to amplify demands that U.S. cultural organizations disavow donors believed to have profited from the Putin regime. It was produced by the Anti-Corruption Data Collective, a group of academics, data analysts and policy advocates working to expose transnational corruption.

Businesses are fleeing Russia. McDonald’s and Pizza Hut are sticking around.

Economic sanctions from the United States and its allies have cut Russia off from the levers of international finance, crucial webs of global supply chains, passenger air travel and even some oil companies.

But consumers can still get a Big Mac in Moscow. Or a Starbucks coffee. Or KFC’s chicken and Papa John’s pizza.

As Western corporate titans flee their Russian connections — citing moral and economic imperatives — others, especially in food service and natural-resource-based industries, say they are stuck. McDonald’s, Starbucks, Papa John’s and Yum Brands — the conglomerate behind KFC and Pizza Hut — have all stayed mum on their plans for business in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine even as they come under growing pressure on social media and from large investors to quit Russia.

Dozens of marquee names have suspended operations — including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil — in response to the unprovoked attack that has devastated Ukraine and drawn international condemnation. But others are walking a finer line, such as French oil company TotalEnergies, which said it would halt new spending in Russia but maintain its partnerships there, including a nearly 20 percent stake in Russian gas producer Novatek.

Boeing, meanwhile, announced Monday that it would look elsewhere for the titanium it uses for its passenger jets, but it stopped short of pulling out of a joint venture to produce it. Russia’s metal industry — key to electric vehicles and semiconductor chips — is so dominant that analysts speculate it may be “too big to sanction.”

The moves show how deeply entrenched certain industries are in the regional and Russian economy.

Even Russian-speaking Ukrainians don’t want to be evacuated to Russia or Belarus

Russia announced six new evacuation routes — allowing Ukrainians to flee the conflict by heading to Russia or Belarus. The Ukrainian government decried the suggestion, demanding safe routes to allow Ukrainians to flee to Poland and elsewhere in Europe.

This news is the latest example of Russia’s faulty assumptions about Ukraine and expectations of an easy victory . As Russian troops entered the country just two weeks ago, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations declared , “the people of Ukraine will be happy when they are liberated from the regime that occupied them .”

To justify the invasion and previous occupation of the Donbas region, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly argued that Ukrainians in the eastern parts of the country are ethnic Russians living under Ukrainian occupation.

“People who identify as Russians and want to preserve their identity, language and culture are getting the signal that they are not wanted in Ukraine,” Putin said in a recent address to Russian citizens. Russians seem to believe him , as does Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to former president Donald Trump, who wrote about “legitimate ethnic problems” in Ukraine.

Research in political psychology shows that Ukraine’s Russian-speaking population does not require rescue by Russia — or even want it. Here’s what we know.

‘I always dreamed of visiting my ancestral home of Odessa. But not like this.’

ODESSA, Ukraine — The first time in 24 years that I saw my great-aunt, I was wearing my bulletproof vest with “PRESS” stamped on the front.

Visiting Odessa, the city where my parents and their parents were born, had been a dream of mine for years. Each time I mentioned to someone in Ukraine that my family was from there, they’d opine on the city’s charms. And each time, I’d admit in shame that I’d yet to experience them myself.

Then, when I got in Ukraine on Jan. 23, I started considering what stories I could report from Odessa so I could at last work in a pilgrimage. It wasn’t hard; my job was to write about the lead-up to what the United States was warning would soon be a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. Odessa, a large Black Sea port, was an obvious target because of its economic importance to Ukraine.

But while my reporting took me all over Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where the country’s military has been battling Russian-backed separatists since 2014, and to Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, just 25 miles from the Russian border, the Odessa trip kept getting postponed.

Now that I’m finally here, I wish I wasn’t.

Video shows Russian police scrolling through people’s phones in Moscow near Lubyanka Square on Sunday. Other video separately shows police making arrests. One of the women being escorted away by police held a sign that said “Peace.” According to the independent human rights organization OVD-Info, more than 4,500 protesters were arrested Sunday at antiwar demonstrations across Russia.

The footage was posted by Russian journalist Anna Vasilyeva. She wrote on Telegram that the police stopped people and asked to see what they had on their phones. She said when she asked why the police checked her press card and didn’t answer her.

IRPIN, Ukraine — On Monday morning, Oksana Shumskaya didn’t know what awaited her on the other side of the destroyed bridge. Was it death, as it was for the four residents of this city killed by a Russian mortar shell the day before? Or was it escape, which she desperately wanted?

She suffered from diabetes, hypertension and a heart ailment. Her severe arthritis meant she couldn’t walk up steps to take a train, or she would have left days ago. She, her daughter and their cat, Barsik, had not left their apartment in nine days. But now Russian forces were inside their city and the shelling was getting close to home.

It was time to flee.

“We took only the cat and my medicines,” said Shumskaya, 65, breathing heavily.

Her daughter, Julia, carried a small wooden stool for her mother to rest on.

They joined hundreds of panicked residents of this city on the northern outskirts of the capital, Kyiv, who fled across a damaged bridge on Monday, seeking to escape the advancing Russians.

As Russian and Ukrainian forces traded ukrainian shells, many of those fleeing were elderly people, some too frail to walk on their own. Others were in wheelchairs or on crutches. They struggled to cross over narrow wooden planks placed over the Irpin River, where the bridge had been destroyed by Ukrainian forces to hamper a possible Russian move toward the capital.

At least one elderly woman was pushed in a wheelbarrow. Others were carried on the backs of sons or grandsons, Ukrainian territorial defense unit volunteers, even generous strangers.

Baltic states urge allies to ramp up defense in face of Russian threat

TALLINN, Estonia — For years, Europe’s Baltic states sounded the alarm about the looming threat from Russia and urged NATO to strengthen its eastern defenses.

On Monday, Lithuania’s leader issued another grim warning: Russian President Vladimir Putin may “not stop” in Ukraine.

“Deterrence is no longer enough, and we need more defense,” President Gitanas Nauseda said ahead of talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius.

“Because otherwise, it will be too late here, Mr. Secretary,” he said. “Putin will not stop in Ukraine; he will not stop.”

Blinken was in the Baltic states Monday as part of a European tour to shore up support among Western allies as Russia’s war in Ukraine intensifies. He reassured Latvia and Lithuania, both of which are NATO members, of continued support and said that some 400 additional U.S. troops would soon be arriving in Lithuania.

The Baltic states, which include Estonia, have “formed a democratic wall that now stands against the tide of autocracy” that Russia is helping create in Europe, Blinken said from the Latvian capital, Riga.

“Latvians who lived through decades of Soviet occupation understand deeply how wrong this is, and how the world must defend Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign, democratic country, free to choose its own future,” he said. “Latvia has done just that.”

As fighting rages in civilian areas, more children are dying, and many others are ‘deeply traumatized’

As the Kremlin has escalated its shelling of civilian areas across Ukraine, schools, hospitals and orphanages have come under attack, imperiling an increasing number of children who have been caught in the crosshairs of Russian missiles while fleeing the war zone or seeking cover.

In 12 days of fighting, at least 27 children have been killed and 42 wounded, UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell told the U.N. Security Council on Monday. Accurate casualty counts are virtually impossible to ascertain because of the rapidly changing situation on the ground, and the United Nations has said it believes that the real figures are “considerably higher” than what the body has reported.

Reporting from the front lines has revealed harrowing scenes of widespread suffering. Russell, who had recently returned from a refugee camp in Romania, recounted stories of families ripped apart, children pulled from school and left without their favorite toys, sheltering through nights of shelling and gunfire.

“So many children have been deeply traumatized,” Russell said.

As fighting continues in densely populated areas, she said, “we expect child casualties to increase.”

Alexandar Markushin, the mayor of a town on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital, said Sunday that he witnessed a Russian mortar blast kill two children and two adults .

“I want to emphasize these were peaceful residents,” he said in a video.

Footage of the attack was verified by The Washington Post, and such images “must shock the conscience of the world,” Russell said.

She said that at least half of the 1.7 million people who have fled Ukraine are children and called for an immediate cease-fire to allow for further evacuations.

“This brutality must come to an end. Children in Ukraine need help and protection,” Russell said. “They need hope for the future. But above all, children in Ukraine need peace.”

Russian forces maintain several fronts in Ukraine, including their efforts to encircle the capital, Kyiv, with troops coming from the north, east and west. Meanwhile, Kharkiv, the second-largest city in the country, continues to be attacked from the air and ground.

In the southern fronts, assaults have increased around Mariupol, while part of the focus appear to be moving to the city of Zaporizhzhia.

Ukrainian gymnast Illia Kovtun shook the hand of the silver medalist he’d just beaten as the two athletes stood on the podium Saturday to accept their medals. He did not extend the same courtesy to the bronze medalist on his left.

Ivan Kuliak , a 20-year-old Russian gymnast, was wearing a white “Z” on his chest. While the letter doesn’t exist in the Russian alphabet, it’s quickly emerging as a way for Russians, following “a propaganda campaign,” to show support for invading Ukraine and rally around a new nationalism, an expert said.

The International Gymnastics Federation, the sport’s global governing body, said it will request a disciplinary investigation into what it called “shocking behaviour” from Kuliak. Regardless, the Taishan World Cup Artistic Gymnastics in Doha, Qatar, was one of the last international events in which Kuliak can compete. Starting Monday, all Russian and Belarusian athletes are banned from participating in its competitions, the federation announced Friday .

War in Ukraine: What you need to know

The latest: President Zelensky condemned as an atrocity a Russian airstrike that tore through a maternity hospital in Mariupol on Wednesday, injuring at least 17. Meanwhile, in the U.S., House lawmakers approved new humanitarian, economic and military assistance to Ukraine worth approximately $14 billion .

Oil exports: Russia is the world’s largest oil exporter, sending more than 7 million barrels of crude oil to countries around the world , including to Germany and other E.U. members.

The fight: Casualties are mounting in Ukraine — including civilians, while Moscow is facing allegations that it has used cluster and vacuum weapons . As many as 4,000 Russian soldiers may have died , according to a U.S. general.

Map: Russia’s assault on Ukraine has been extensive with strikes and attacks across the entire country.

The response: Russia’s war could be a global economic “game changer,” with rising gas prices and shifting trade decisions suggesting change that will be felt for years. Meanwhile, in Russia, online access has been significantly curtailed by censors at home and businesses abroad.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating .
