Course book denition
The IB Diploma Programme course books are resource materials designed to support students throughout their two-year Diploma Programme course of study in a particular subject. They will help students gain an understanding of what is expected from the study of an IB Diploma Programme subject while presenting content in a way that illustrates the purpose and aims of the IB. They reect the philosophy and approach of the IB and encourage a deep understanding of each subject by making connections to wider issues and providing opportunities for critical thinking.
The books mirror the IB philosophy of viewing the curriculum in terms of a whole-course approach; the use of a wide range of resources, international mindedness, the IB learner prole and the IB Diploma Programme core requirements, theory of knowledge, the extended essay, and creativity, action, service (CAS).
Each book can be used in conjunction with other materials and indeed, students of the IB are required and encouraged to draw conclusions from a variety of resources. Suggestions for additional and further reading are given in each book and suggestions for how to extend research are provided.
In addition, the course companions provide advice and guidance on the specic course assessment requirements and on academic honesty protocol. They are distinctive and authoritative without being prescriptive.

The IB Learner Prole
The aim of all IB programmes to develop internationally minded people who work to create a better and more peaceful world. The aim of the programme is to develop this person through ten learner attributes, as described below.
Inquirers: They develop their natural curiosity. They acquire the skills necessary to conduct inquiry and research and snow independence in learning. They actively enjoy learning and this love of learning will be sustained throughout their lives.
Knowledgeable: They explore concepts, ideas, and issues that have local and global signicance. In so doing, they acquire in-depth knowledge and develop understanding across a broad and balanced range of disciplines.
Thinkers: They exercise initiative in applying thinking skills critically and creatively to recognize and approach complex problems, and make reasoned, ethical decisions.
Communicators: They understand and express ideas and information condently and creatively in more than one language and in a variety of modes of communication. They work effectively and willingly in collaboration with others.
Principled: They act with integrity and honesty, with a strong sense of fairness, justice and respect for the dignity of the individual, groups and communities. They take responsibility for their own action and the consequences that accompany them.

IB mission statement
The International Baccalaureate aims to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.

Open-minded: They understand and appreciate their own cultures and personal histories, and are open to the perspectives, values and traditions of other individuals and communities. They are accustomed to seeking and evaluating a range of points of view, and are willing to grow from the experience.

To this end the organization works with schools, governments and international organizations to develop challenging programmes of international education and rigorous assessment.
These programmes encourage students across the world to become active, compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right.

Caring: They show empathy, compassion and respect towards the needs and feelings of others. They have a personal commitment to service, and to act to make a positive difference to the lives of others and to the environment.
Risk-takers: They approach unfamiliar situations and uncertainty with courage and forethought, and have the independence of spirit to explore new roles, ideas, and strategies. They are brave and articulate in defending their beliefs.

iv

Balanced: They understand the importance of intellectual, physical and emotional ballance to achieve personal well-being for themselves and others.
Reective: They give thoughtful consideration to their own learning and experience. They are able to assess and understand their strengths and limitations in order to support their learning and personal development.

A note on academic honesty
It is of vital importance to acknowledge and appropriately credit the owners of information when that information is used in your work. After all, owners of ideas (intellectual property) have property rights. To have an authentic piece of work, it must be based on your individual and original ideas with the work of others fully acknowledged. Therefore, all assignments, written or oral, completed for assessment must use your own language and expression. Where sources are used or referred to, whether in the form of direct quotation or paraphrase, such sources must be appropriately acknowledged.
How do I acknowledge the work of others? The way that you acknowledge that you have used the ideas of other people is through the use of footnotes and bibliographies.

Footnotes (placed at the bottom of a page) or

endnotes (placed at the end of a document) are

to be provided when you quote or paraphrase

from another document, or closely summarize the

information provided in another document.

You

do not need to provide a footnote for information

that is part of a ‘body of knowledge’. That is,

denitions do not need to be footnoted as they are

part of the assumed knowledge.

Bibliographies should include a formal list of the

resources that you used in your work.

‘Formal’

means that you should use one of the several

accepted forms of presentation. This usually

involves separating the resources that you use

into different categories (e.g. books, magazines,

newspaper articles, internet-based resources, Cds

and works of art) and providing full information

as to how a reader or viewer of your work can

nd the same information. A bibliography is

compulsory in the Extended Essay.

What constitutes malpractice? Malpractice is behaviour that results in, or may result in, you or any student gaining an unfair advantage in one or more assessment component. Malpractice includes plagiarism and collusion.

Plagiarism is dened as the representation of the ideas or work of another person as your own. The following are some of the ways to avoid plagiarism:

●

words and ideas of another person to support one’s arguments must be acknowledged

●

passages that are quoted verbatim must be enclosed within quotation marks and acknowledged

●

CD-Roms, email messages, web sites on the Internet and any other electronic media must be treated in the same way as books and journals

●

the sources of all photographs, maps, illustrations, computer programs, data, graphs, audio-visual and similar material must be acknowledged if they are not your own work

●

works of art, whether music, lm dance,

theatre arts or visual arts

and where the

creative use of a part of a work takes place, the

original artist must be acknowledged.

Collusion is dened as supporting malpractice by another student. This includes:

●

allowing your work to be copied or submitted for assessment by another student

●

duplicating work for different assessment components and/or diploma requirements.

Other forms of malpractice include any action that gives you an unfair advantage or affects the results of another student. Examples include, taking unauthorized material into an examination room, misconduct during an examination and falsifying a CAS record.

This book is a companion for students of Biology in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Biology is the most popular choice of science subject as part of the IB diploma. The study of biology should lead students to appreciate the interconnectedness of life within the biosphere. With a focus on understanding the nature of science, IB Biology will allow you to develop a level of scientic literacy that will better prepare you to act on issues of local and global concern, with a full understanding of the scientic point of view. The structure of this book is closely based on the biology programme in the Subject Guide. Subheadings restate the specic assessment statements. Topics 1 – 6 explain in detail the Core material that is common to both SL and HL courses. Topics 7 – 11 explain the AHL (additional higher level material). Topics A, B, C and D cover the content of the options. All topics include the following elements:
Understanding
The specics of the content requirements for each sub-topic are covered in detail. Concepts are presented in ways that will promote enduring understanding.

Nature of science
Here you can explore the methods of science and some of the knowledge issues that are associated with scientic endeavour. This is done using carefully selected examples, including biological research that led to paradigm shifts in our understanding of the natural world.
Thory of K nowd
These shor t sections have headings that are equivocal `knowledge questions´. The text that follows often details one possible answer to the knowledge question. We encourage you draw on these examples of knowledge issues in your TOK essays. Of course, much of the material elsewhere in the book , par ticularly in the nature of science sections, can be used to prompt TOK discussions.
acti vity A variety of shor t topics are included under this heading with the focus in all cases on active learning. We encourage you research these topics yourself, using information available in textbooks or on the Internet. The aim is to promote an independent approach to learning. We believe that the optimal approach to learning is to be active – the more that you do for yourself, guided by your teacher, the better you will learn.

Applications
These sections help you to develop your understanding by studying a specic illustrative example or learning about a signicant experiment in the history of biology.

Skills topics

These sections encourage you to apply your

understanding through practical activities

and analysis of results from classic biological

research. In some cases this involves instructions

for handling data from experiments and also

use of ICT. Some of the skills sections involve

experiments with known outcomes, aimed at

promoting understanding through “doing and

seeing.”

Others involve ideas for experimental

work with unknown outcomes, where you can

dene the problem and the methods. These are a

valuable opportunities to build the skills that are

assessed in IA (see page 708).

Data-based questions These questions involve studying and analysing data from biological research – this type of question appears in both Paper 2 and Paper 3 for SL and HL IB Biology. Answers to these questions can be found at www.oxfordsecondary.co.uk/ib-biology

1 CELL BIOLOGY

Introduction
There is an unbroken chain of life from the rst cells on Earth to all cells found in organisms alive today. Eukaryotes have a much more complex cell structure than prokaryotes. The evolution of multicellular organisms allowed cell specialization and cell replacement. Cell division is essential but is carried out differently

in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. While evolution has resulted in a biological world of enormous diversity, the study of cells shows us that there are also universal features. For example, the uid and dynamic structure of biological membranes allows them to control the composition of cells.

CELL BIOLOGY

The cell theory

Living organisms are composed of cells.
The internal structure of living organisms is very intricate and is built up from very small individual parts. Organs such as the kidney and the eye are easily visible. If they are dissected we can see that large organs are made of a number of different tissues, but until microscopes were invented little or nothing was discovered about the structure of tissues. From the 17th century onwards biologists examined tissues from both plants and animals using microscopes. Although there was much variation, certain features were seen again and again. A theory was developed to explain the basic features of structure – the cell theory. This states that cells are the fundamental building blocks of all living organisms. The smallest organisms are unicellular – they consist of just one cell. Larger organisms are multicellular – they are composed of many cells.

Cells vary considerably in size and shape but they share certain common features:

●

Every living cell is surrounded by a membrane, which separates the cell contents from everything else outside.

●

Cells contain genetic material which stores all of the instructions needed for the cell’s activities.

●

Many of these activities are chemical reactions, catalysed by enzymes produced inside the cell.

●

Cells have their own energy release system that powers all of the cell’s activities.

So, cells can be thought of as the smallest living structures – nothing smaller can survive.

Exceptions to the cell theory
Looking for trends and discrepancies: although most organisms conform to cell theory, there are exceptions.
An early stage in scientic investigation is to look for trends – things that appear to be found generally rather than just in specic cases. These trends can lead to the development of a theory. A scientic theory is a way of interpreting the natural world. Theories allow us to make predictions. Sometimes exceptions to a general trend are found. These are called discrepancies. Scientists have to judge whether the discrepancies are common or serious enough to make predictions too unreliable to be useful. The theory is then discarded.
The cell theory is an example of where scientists have looked for trends and discrepancies. Robert Hooke was the rst to use the word cell for structures in living organisms. He did this in 1665 after examining cork and other parts of plants. After describing cells in cork he wrote this:
Nor is this kind of texture peculiar to cork only, for upon examination with my microscope I have found that the pith of the Elder or almost any other tree, the inner pith of the Cany hollow stems of several other vegetables: as of Fennel, Carrets, Daucus, Bur-docks, Teasels, Fearn, some kind of Reeds etc. have much such a kind of Schematisme, as I have lately shown that of cork.
So Hooke wasn’t content with looking at just one type of plant tissue – he looked at many and discovered a general trend. Since Hooke’s day biologists have looked at tissues from a huge variety of living organisms. Many of these tissues have been found to consist of cells, so the cell theory has not been discarded. However, some discrepancies have been discovered – organisms or parts of organisms that do not consist of typical cells. More discrepancies may be discovered, but it is extremely unlikely that the cell theory will ever be discarded, because so many tissues do consist of cells.

These two answers represent the holistic and the reductionist approach in biology.

Focusing

Types of slide

●

Put the slide on the stage, with the most promising region exactly in the middle of the hole in the stage that the light comes through.

●

Always focus at low power rst even if eventually you need high power magnication.

●

Focus with the larger coarse-focusing knobs rst, then when you have nearly got the image in focus make it really sharp using the smaller ne-focusing knobs.

●

If you want to increase the magnication, move the slide so the most promising region is exactly in the middle of the eld of view and then change to a higher magnication lens.

Looking after your microscope

●

Always focus by moving the lens and the specimen further apart, never closer to each other.

●

Make sure that the slide is clean and dry before putting it on the stage.

●

Never touch the surfaces of the lenses with your ngers or anything else.

●

Carry the microscope carefully with a hand under it to support its weight securely.

The slides that we examine with a microscope can be permanent or temporary.

Making permanent slides is very skilled and takes a long time, so these slides are normally made by experts. Permanent slides of tissues are made using very thin slices of tissue.

Making temporary slides is quicker and easier so we can do this for ourselves.
Examining and drawing plant and animal cells Almost all cells are too small to be seen with thenaked eye, so a microscope is needed to studythem.

It is usually easy to see whether a cell is from a plant or an animal, even though there are many different cell types in both the plant and animal kingdoms.

●

Place the cells on the slide in a layer not more than one cell thick.

●

Add a drop of water or stain.

●

Carefully lower a cover slip onto the drop. Try to avoid trapping any air bubbles.

Troubleshooting Problem: Nothing is visible when I try to focus. Solution: Make sure the specimen is actually under the lens, by carefully positioning the slide. It is easier to nd the specimen if you focus at low power rst.
Problem: A circle with a thick black rim is visible. Solution: There is an air bubble on the slide. Ignore it and try to improve your technique for making slides so that there are no air bubbles.

●

Remove excess uid or stain by putting the slide inside a folded piece of paper towel and pressing lightly on the cover slip.

It is best to examine the slide rst using low power. Move the slide to get the most promising areas in the middle of the eld of view and then move up to high power. Draw a few cells, so you remember their structure.

carefully lower the cover slip

Problem: There are blurred parts of the image even when I focus it as well as Ican. Solution: Either the lenses or the slide have dirt on them. Ask your teacher to clean it. Problem: The image is very dark. Solution: Increase the amount of light passing through the specimen by adjusting the diaphragm. Problem: The image looks rather bleached. Solution: Decrease the amount of light passing through the specimen by adjusting the diaphragm.

Drawing cells

Drawing cell structures as seen with the light microscope.
Careful drawings are a useful way of recording the structure of cells or other biological structures. Usually the lines on the drawing represent the edges of structures. Do not show unnecessary detail and only use faint shading. Drawings of structures seen using a microscope will be larger than the structures actually are – the drawing shows them magnied. On page 6 the method for calculating the magnication of a drawing is explained. Everything on a drawing should be shown to the same magnication.

a) Use a sharp pencil with a hard lead to draw single sharp lines.

b) Join up lines carefully to form continuous structures such as cells

c) Draw lines freehand, but use a ruler for labelling lines.

CELL BIOLOGY

Calculation of magnication and actual size

Calculation of the magnication of drawings and the actual size of structures shown

in drawings or micrographs.

When we look down a microscope the structures that we see appear larger than they actually are. The microscope is magnifying them. Most microscopes allow us to magnify specimens by two or three different factors. This is done by rotating the turret to switch from one objective lens to another. A typical school microscope has three levels of magnication:

●

× 40 (low power)

●

× 100 (medium power)

●

× 400 (high power)

If we take a photo down a microscope, we can magnify the image even more. A photo taken down a microscope is called a micrograph. There are many micrographs in this book, including electron micrographs taken using an electron microscope.

It is very important when using this formula to make sure that the units for the size of the image and actual size of the specimen are the same. They could both be millimetres (mm) or micrometres (µm) but they must not be different or the calculation will be wrong. Millimetres can be converted to micrometres by multiplying by one thousand. Micrometres can be converted to millimetres by dividing by one thousand.
Scale bars are sometimes put on micrographs or drawings, or just alongside them. These are straight lines, with the actual size that the scale bar represents. For example, if there was a 10 mm long scale bar on a micrograph with a magnication of ×10,000 the scale bar would have a label of 1 µm.
EX AMPLE:

When we draw a specimen, we can make the drawing larger or smaller, so the magnication of the drawing isn’t necessarily the same as the magnication of the microscope.

To nd the magnication of a micrograph or a drawing we need to know two things: the size of the image (in the drawing or the micrograph) and the actual size of the specimen. This formula is used for the calculation:

magnication =

size of image ___

actual size of specimen

If we know the size of the image and the magnication, we can calculate the actual size of a specimen.

The length of an image is 30 mm. It represents a structure that has an actual size of 3 µm. Determine the magnication of the image.

Either:

30 mm = 30 × 10

Testing the cell theory

Questioning the cell theory using atypical examples, including striated muscle,

giant algae and aseptate fungal hyphae.
To test the cell theory you should look at the structure of as many living organisms as you can, using a microscope. Instructions for microscope use are given on page 4. In each case you should ask the question, “Does the organism or tissue t the trend stated in the cell theory by consisting of one or more cells?”

In humans they have an average length of about 30 mm, whereas other human cells are mostly less than 0.03 mm in length. Instead of having one nucleus they have many, sometimes as many as several hundred.

Three atypical examples are worth considering:

●

Striated muscle is the type of tissue that we use to change the position of our body. The building blocks of this tissue are muscle bres, which are similar in some ways to cells. They are surrounded by a membrane and are formed by division of pre-existing cells. They have their own genetic material and their own energy release system. However muscle bres are far from typical. They are much larger than most animal cells.

▲ Figure 12 Striated muscle bres

CELL BIOLOGY

●

Fungi consist of narrow thread-like structures called hyphae. These hyphae are usually white in colour and have a uffy appearance. They have a cell membrane and, outside it, a cell wall. In some types of fungi the hyphae are divided up into small cell-like sections by cross walls called septa. However, in aseptate fungi there are no septa. Each hypha is an uninterrupted tube-like structure with many nuclei spread along it.

●

Algae are organisms that feed themselves by photosynthesis and store their genes inside nuclei, but they are simpler in their structure and organization than plants. Many algae consist of one microscopic cell. There are vast numbers of these unicellular algae in the oceans and they form the basis of most marine food chains. Less common are some algae that grow to a much larger size, yet they still seem to be single cells. They are known as giant algae. Acetabularia is one example. It can grow to a length of as much as 100 mm, despite only having one nucleus. If a new organism with a length of 100 mm was discovered, we would certainly expect it to consist of many cells, not just one.

▲ Figure 13 Aseptate hypha ▲ Figure 14 Giant alga

Unicellular organisms

Organisms consisting of only one cell carry out all functions of life in that cell.
The functions of life are things that all organisms must do to stay alive. Some organisms consist of only one cell. This cell therefore has to carry out all the functions of life. Because of this the structure of unicellular organisms is more complex than most cells in multicellular organisms.

Unicellular organisms carry out at least seven functions of life:

●

Nutrition – obtaining food, to provide energy and the materials needed for growth.

●

Metabolism – chemical reactions inside the cell, including cell respiration to release energy.

●

Growth – an irreversible increase in size.

●

Response – the ability to react to changes in the environment.

●

Excretion – getting rid of the waste products of metabolism.

●

Homeostasis – keeping conditions inside the organism within tolerable limits.

●

Reproduction – producing offspring either sexually or asexually.

Many unicellular organisms also have a method of movement, but some remain in a xed position or merely drift in water or air currents.

Limitations on cell size

Surface area to volume ratio is impor tant in the limitation of cell size.
In the cytoplasm of cells, large numbers of chemical reactions take place. These reactions are known collectively as the metabolism of the cell. The rate of these reactions (the metabolic rate of the cell) is proportional to the volume of the cell.
For metabolism to continue, substances used in the reactions must be absorbed by the cell and waste products must be removed. Substances move into and out of cells through the plasma membrane at the surface of the cell. The rate at which substances cross this membrane depends on its surface area.
The surface area to volume ratio of a cell is therefore very important. If the ratio is too small then substances will not enter the cell as quickly as they are required and waste products will accumulate because they are produced more rapidly than they can be excreted.
Surface area to volume ratio is also important in relation to heat production and loss. If the ratio is too small then cells may overheat because the metabolism produces heat faster than it is lost over the cell’ssurface.

Functions of life in unicellular organisms Investigation of functions of life in Paramecium and one named photosynthetic unicellular organism.
Paramecium is a unicellular organism that can be cultured quite easily in the laboratory. Alternatively collect some pond water and use a centrifuge to concentrate the organisms in it to see if Paramecium is present. Place a drop of culture solution containing Paramecium on a microscope slide. Add a cover slip and examine the slide with a microscope.

The nucleus of the cell can divide to produce the ex tra nuclei that are needed when the cell reproduces. Often the reproduction is asexual with the parent cell dividing to form two daughter cells.
Food vacuoles contain smaller organisms that the Paramecium has consumed. These are gradually digested and the nutrients are absorbed into the cytoplasm where they provide energy and materials needed for growth.
The cell membrane controls what chemicals enter and leave. It allows the entry of oxygen for respiration. Excretion happens simply by waste products diusing out through the membrane.

The contractile vacuoles at each end of the cell ll up with water and then expel it through the plasma membrane of the cell, to keep the cell’s water content within tolerable limits.
Metabolic reactions take place in the cytoplasm, including the reactions that release energy by respiration. Enzymes in the cytoplasm are the catalysts that cause these reactions to happen.
Beating of the cilia moves the Paramecium through the water and this can be controlled by the cell so that it moves in a par ticular direction in response to changes in the environment.

Beating of the two agella moves the Chlamydomonas through the water. A lightsensitive “eyespot” allows the cell to sense where the brightest light is and respond by swimming towards it.

▲ Figure 18 Volvox colonies 10

Multicellular organisms
Multicellular organisms have proper ties that emerge from the interaction of their cellular components.
Some unicellular organisms live together in colonies, for example a type of alga called Volvox aureus. Each colony consists of a ball made of a protein gel, with 500 or more identical cells attached to its surface. Figure 18 shows two colonies, with daughter colonies forming inside them. Although the cells are cooperating, they are not fused to form a single cell mass and so are not a single organism.
Organisms consisting of a single mass of cells, fused together, are multicellular. One of the most intensively researched multicellular organisms is a worm called Caenorhabditis elegans. The adult body is about one millimetre long and it is made up of exactly 959 cells. This might seem like a large number, but most multicellular organisms have far more cells. There are about ten million million cells in an adult human body and even more in organisms such as oak trees or whales.
Although very well known to biologists, Caenorhabditis elegans has no common name and lives unseen in decomposing organic matter. It feeds on the bacteria that cause decomposition. C. elegans has a mouth, pharynx, intestine and anus. It is hermaphrodite so has both male and female reproductive organs. Almost a third of the cells are neurons, or

1 .1 In t r od u c t Ion to c e ll s

nerve cells. Most of these neurons are located at the front end of the worm in a structure that can be regarded as the animal’s brain.
Although the brain in C. elegans coordinates responses to the worm’s environment, it does not control how individual cells develop. The cells in this and other multicellular organisms can be regarded as cooperative groups, without any cells in the group acting as a leader or supervisor. It is remarkable how individual cells in a group can organize themselves and interact with each other to form a living organism with distinctive overall properties. The characteristics of the whole organism, including the fact that it is alive, are known as emergent properties.
Emergent properties arise from the interaction of the component parts of a complex structure. We sometimes sum this up with the phrase: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. A simple example of an emergent property was described in a Chinese philosophical text written more than 2,500 years ago: “Pots are fashioned from clay. But it’s the hollow that makes the pot work.” So, in biology we can carry out research by studying component parts, but we must remember that some bigger things result from interactions between these components.
Cell dierentiation in multicellular organisms
Specialized tissues can develop by cell dierentiation in multicellular organisms.
In multicellular organisms different cells perform different functions. This is sometimes called division of labour. In simple terms, a function is a job or a role. For example the function of a red blood cell is to carry oxygen, and the function of a rod cell in the retina of the eye is to absorb light and then transmit impulses to the brain. Often a group of cells specialize in the same way to perform the same function. They are called a tissue.
By becoming specialized, the cells in a tissue can carry out their role more efciently than if they had many different roles. They can develop the ideal structure, with the enzymes needed to carry out all of the chemical reactions associated with the function. The development of cells in different ways to carry out specic functions is called differentiation. In humans, 220 distinctively different highly specialized cell types have been recognized, all of which develop by differentiation.
Gene expression and cell dierentiation
Dierentiation involves the expression of some genes and not others in a cell’s genome.
There are many different cell types in a multicellular organism but they all have the same set of genes. The 220 cell types in the human body have the same set of genes, despite large differences in their structure and activities. To take an example, rod cells in the retina of the eye produce a pigment that absorbs light. Without it, the rod cell would not be able to do its job of sensing light. A lens cell in the eye produces no pigments and is transparent. If it did contain pigments, less light would

An emergent proper ty of a system is not a proper ty of any one component of the system, but it is a proper ty of the system as a whole. Emergence refers to how complex systems and patterns arise from many small and relatively simple interactions. We cannot therefore necessarily predict emergent proper ties by studying each par t of a system separately (an approach known as reductionism). Molecular biology is an example of the success that a reductionist approach can have. Many processes occurring in living organisms have been explained at a molecular level. However, many argue that reductionism is less useful in the study of emergent proper ties including intelligence, consciousness and other aspects of psychology. The interconnectivity of the components in cases like these is at least as impor tant as the functioning of each individual component.
One approach that has been used to study interconnectivity and emergent proper ties is computer modelling. In both animal behaviour and ecology, a programme known as the “Game of Life” has been used. It was devised by John Conway and is available on the Internet. Test the “Game of Life” by creating initial congurations of cells and seeing how they evolve. Research ways in which the model has been applied.

pass through the lens and our vision would be worse. While they are developing, both cell types contain the genes for making the pigment, but these genes are only used in the rod cell.
This is the usual situation – cells do not just have genes with the instructions that they need, they have genes needed to specialize in every possible way. There are approximately 25,000 genes in the human genome, and these genes are all present in a body cell. However, in most cell types less than half of the genes will ever be needed or used.
When a gene is being used in a cell, we say that the gene is being expressed. In simple terms, the gene is switched on and the information in it is used to make a protein or other gene product. The development of a cell involves switching on particular genes and expressing them, but not others. Cell differentiation happens because a different sequence of genes is expressed in different cell types. The control of gene expression is therefore the key to development.
An extreme example of differentiation involves a large family of genes in humans that carry the information for making receptors for odorants – smells. These genes are only expressed in cells in the skin inside the nose, called olfactory receptor cells. Each of these cells expresses just one of the genes and so makes one type of receptor to detect one type of odorant. This is how we can distinguish between so many different smells. Richard Axel and Linda Buck were given the Nobel Prize in 2004 for their work on this system.

A new animal life starts when a sperm fertilizes an egg cell to produce a zygote. An embryo is formed when the zygote divides to give two cells. This two-cell embryo divides again to produce a four-cell embryo, then eight, sixteen and so on. At these early stages in embryonic development the cells are capable of dividing many times to produce large amounts of tissue. They are also extremely versatile and can differentiate along different pathways into any of the cell types found in that particular animal. In the 19th century, the name stem cell was given to the zygote and the cells of the early embryo, meaning that all the tissues of the adult stem from them.

Stem cells have two key properties that have made them one of the most active areas of research in biology and medicine today.

●

Stem cells can divide again and again to produce copious quantities of new cells. They are therefore useful for the growth of tissues or the replacement of cells that have been lost or damaged.

●

Stem cells are not fully differentiated. They can differentiate in different ways, to produce different cell types.

Embryonic stem cells are therefore potentially very useful. They could be used to produce regenerated tissue, such as skin for people who have suffered burns. They could provide a means of healing diseases such as type 1 diabetes where a particular cell type has been lost or is malfunctioning. They might even be used in the future to grow whole replacement organs – hearts or kidneys, for example. These types of use are called therapeutic, because they provide therapies for diseases or other health problems.
There are also non-therapeutic uses for embryonic stem cells. One possibility is to use them to produce large quantities of striated muscle bres, or meat, for human consumption. The beef burgers of the future may therefore be produced from stem cells, without the need to rear and slaughter cattle.
It is the early stage embryonic stem cells that are the most versatile. Gradually during embryo development the cells commit themselves to a pattern of differentiation. This involves a series of points at which a cell decides whether to develop along one pathway or another. Eventually each cell becomes committed to develop into one specic cell type. Once committed, a cell may still be able to divide, but all of these cells will differentiate in the same way and they are no longer stem cells.
Small numbers of cells remain as stem cells, however, and they are still present in the adult body. They are present in many human tissues, including bone marrow, skin and liver. They give some human tissues considerable powers of regeneration and repair. The stem cells in other tissues only allow limited repair – brain, kidney and heart for example.

Therapeutic uses of stem cells

Use of stem cells to treat Stargardt’s disease and one other named condition.

There are a few current uses of stem cells to treat diseases, and a huge range of possible future uses, many of which are being actively researched. Two examples are given here: one involving embryonic stem cells and one using adult stem cells.
Stargardt’s disease The full name of this disease is Stargardt’s macular dystrophy. It is a genetic disease that develops in children between the ages of six and twelve. Most cases are due to a recessive mutation of a gene called ABCA4. This causes a membrane protein used for active transport in retina cells to malfunction. As a consequence, photoreceptive cells in the retina degenerate. These are the cells that detect light, so vision becomes progressively worse. The loss of vision can be severe enough for the person to be registered as blind.

Researchers have developed methods for making embryonic stem cells develop into retina cells. This was done initially with mouse cells, which were then injected into the eyes of mice that had a condition similar to Stargardt’s disease. The injected cells were not rejected, did not develop into tumours or cause any other problems. The cells moved to the retina where they attached themselves and remained. Very encouragingly, they caused an improvement in the vision of the mice.
In November 2010, researchers in the United States got approval for trials in humans. A woman in her 50s with Stargardt’s disease was treated by having 50,000 retina cells derived from embryonic stem cells injected into her eyes. Again the cells attached to the retina and remained there during the four-month trial. There was an improvement in her vision, and no harmful side effects.

Further trials with larger numbers of patients are needed, but after these initial trials at least, we can be optimistic about the development of treatments for Stargardt’s disease using embryonic stem cells.

can be done by treating the patient with chemicals that kill dividing cells. The procedure is known as chemotherapy. However, to remain healthy in the long term the patient must be able to produce the white blood cells needed to ght disease. Stem cells that can produce blood cells must be present, but they are killed by chemotherapy. The following procedure is therefore used:

●

A large needle is inserted into a large bone, usually the pelvis, and uid is removed from the bone marrow.

▲ Figure 20 Stargardt’s disease
lkmia
This disease is a type of cancer. All cancers start when mutations occur in genes that control cell division. For a cancer to develop, several specic mutations must occur in these genes in one cell. This is very unlikely to happen, but as there are huge numbers of cells in the body, the overall chance becomes much larger. More than a quarter of a million cases of leukemia are diagnosed each year globally and there are over 200,000 deaths from the disease.

●

Stem cells are extracted from this uid and are stored by freezing them. They are adult stem cells and only have the potential for producing blood cells.

●

A high dose of chemotherapy drugs is given to the patient, to kill all the cancer cells in the bone marrow. The bone marrow loses its ability to produce blood cells.

●

The stem cells are then returned to the patient’s body. They re-establish themselves in the bone marrow, multiply and start to produce red and white blood cells.

In many cases this procedure cures the leukemia completely.

Once the cancer-inducing mutations have

occurred in a cell, it grows and divides repeatedly,

producing more and more cells. Leukemia involves

the production of abnormally large numbers of

white blood cells. In most cancers, the cancer cells

form a lump or tumour but this does not happen

with leukemia. White blood cells are produced in

the bone marrow, a soft tissue in the hollow centre

of large bones such as the femur. They are then

released into the blood, both in normal conditions

and when excessive numbers are produced with

leukemia. A normal adult white blood cell count is

3

between 4,000 and 11,000 per mm

of blood. In a

person with leukemia this number rises higher and

3

higher. Counts above 30,000 per mm

suggest that

a person may have leukemia. If there are more

3

than 100,000 per mm

it is likely that the person

has acute leukemia.

To cure leukemia, the cancer cells in the bone marrow that are producing excessive numbers of white blood cells must be destroyed. This

The ethics of stem cell research

Ethical implications of research: research involving stem cells is growing in

impor tance and raises ethical issues.
Stem cell research has been very controversial. Many ethical objections have been raised. Scientists should always consider the ethical implications of their research before doing it. Some of the research that was carried out in the past would not be considered ethically acceptable today, such as medical research carried out on patients without their informed consent.

Decisions about whether research is ethically acceptable must be based on a clear understanding of the science involved. Some people dismiss all stem cell research as unethical, but this shows a misunderstanding of the different possible sources of the stem cells being used. In the next section, three possible sources of stem cells and the ethics of research involving them are discussed.

Sources of stem cells and the ethics of using them

Ethics of the therapeutic use of stem cells from specially created embryos, from the umbilical cord blood of a new-born baby and from an adult’s own tissues.
Stem cells can be obtained from a variety of sources.

●

Embryos can be deliberately created by fertilizing egg cells with sperm and allowing the resulting zygote to develop for a few days until it has between four and sixteen cells. All of the cells are embryonic stem cells.

●

Blood can be extracted from the umbilical cord of a new-born baby and stem cells obtained from it. The cells can be frozen

and stored for possible use later in the baby’slife.

●

Stem cells can be obtained from some adult tissues such as bone marrow.

These types of stem cell vary in their properties and therefore in their potential for therapeutic use. The table below gives some properties of the three types, to give the scientic basis for an ethical assessment.

CELL BIOLOGY

Stem cell research has been very controversial. Many ethical objections have been raised. There are most objections to the use of embryonic stem cells, because current techniques usually involve the death of the embryo when the stem cells are taken. The main question is whether an early stage embryo is as much a human individual as a new-born baby, in which case killing the embryo is undoubtedly unethical.
When does a human life begin? There are different views on this. Some consider that when the sperm fertilizes the egg, a human life has begun. Others say that early stage embryos have not yet developed human characteristics and cannot suffer pain, so they should be thought of simply as groups of stem cells. Some suggest that a human life truly begins when there is a heartbeat, or bone tissue or brain activity. These stages take place after a few weeks of development. Another view is that it is only when the embryo has developed into a fetus that is capable of surviving outside the uterus.
Some scientists argue that if embryos are specially created by in vitro fertilization (IVF) in order to obtain stem cells, no human that would otherwise

have lived has been denied its chance of living. However, a counterargument is that it is unethical to create human lives solely for the purpose of obtaining stem cells. Also, IVF involves hormone treatment of women, with some associated risk, as well as an invasive surgical procedure forremoval of eggs from the ovary. If women are paid for supplying eggs for IVF this could lead to the exploitation of vulnerable groups such as college students.

Developments in scientic research follow improvements in apparatus: the

invention of electron microscopes led to greater understanding of cell structure.

Much of the progress in biology over the last 150 years has followed improvements in the design of microscopes. In the second half of the 19th century improved light microscopes allowed the discovery of bacteria and other unicellular organisms. Chromosomes were seen for the rst time and the processes of mitosis, meiosis and gamete formation were discovered. The basis of sexual reproduction, which had previously eluded William Harvey and many other biologists, was seen to be the fusion of gametes and subsequent development of embryos. The complexity of organs such as the kidney was revealed and mitochondria, chloroplasts and other structures were discovered within cells.
There was a limit to the discoveries that could be made though. For technical reasons that are explained later in this sub-topic, light microscopes cannot produce clear images of structures smaller than 0.2 micrometres (μm). (A micrometre is a thousandth of a millimetre.) Many biological structures are smaller than this. For example, membranes in cells are about 0.01 μm thick. Progress was hampered until a different type of microscope was invented – the electron microscope.
Electron microscopes were developed in Germany during the 1930s and came into use in research laboratories in the 1940s and 50s. They allowed

images to be produced of things as small as 0.001 μm – 200 times smaller than with light microscopes. The structure of eukaryotic cells was found to be far more intricate than most biologists had expected and many previous ideas were shown to be wrong. For example, in the 1890s the light microscope had revealed darker green areas in the chloroplast. They were called grana and interpreted as droplets of chlorophyll. The electron microscope showed that grana are in fact stacks of attened membrane sacs, with the chlorophyll located in the membranes. Whereas mitochondria appear as tiny structureless rods or spheres under the light microscope, the electron microscope revealed them to have an intricate internal membrane structure.
The electron microscopes revealed what is now called the ultrastructure of cells, including previously unknown features. Ribosomes, lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum were all discovered and named in the 1950s, for example. It is unlikely that there are structures as signicant as these still to be discovered, but improvements in the design of electron microscopes continue and each improvement allows new discoveries to be made. A recent example, described in subtopic 8.2, is electron tomography – a method of producing 3-D images by electron microscopy.

The resolution of electron microscopes

Electron microscopes have a much higher resolution than light microscopes.
If we look at a tree with unaided eyes we can see its individual leaves, but we cannot see the cells within its leaves. The unaided eye can see things with a size of 0.1 mm as separate objects, but no smaller. To see the cells within the leaf we need to use a light microscope. This allows us to see things with a size of down to about 0.2 μm as separate objects, so cells can become individually visible – they can be distinguished.

Making the separate parts of an object distinguishable by eye is called resolution.

The maximum resolution of a light microscope is 0.2 μm, which is 200 nanometres (nm). However powerful the lenses of a light microscope are, the resolution cannot be higher than this because it is limited by the wavelength of light (400–700 nm). If we try to resolve smaller objects by

While still a young student in Berlin in the late 1920s Ernst Ruska developed magnetic coils that could focus beams of electrons. He worked on the idea of using these lenses to obtain an image as in a light microscope, but with electron beams instead of light. During the 1930s he developed and rened this technology. By 1939 Ruska had designed the rst commercial electron microscope. In 1986 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this pioneering work. Ruska worked with the German rm Siemens. Other companies in Britain, Canada and the United States also developed and manufactured electron microscopes.

dierence?

making lenses with greater magnication, we nd that it is impossible to focus them properly and get a blurred image. This is why the maximum magnication with light microscopes is usually × 400.
Beams of electrons have a much shorter wavelength, so electron microscopes have a much higher resolution. The resolution of modern electron microscopes is 0.001 μm or 1 nm. Electron microscopes therefore have a resolution that is 200 times greater than light microscopes. This is why light microscopes reveal the structure of cells, but electron microscopes reveal the ultrastructure. It explains why light microscopes were needed to see bacteria with a size of 1 micrometre, but viruses with a diameter of 0.1 micrometres could not be seen until electron microscopes had been invented.

Prokaryotic cell structure Prokaryotes have a simple cell structure without compar tments
All organisms can be divided into two groups according to their cell structure. Eukaryotes have a compartment within the cell that contains the chromosomes. It is called the nucleus and is bounded by a nuclear envelope consisting of a double layer of membrane. Prokaryotes do not have a nucleus.
Prokaryotes were the rst organisms to evolve on Earth and they still have the simplest cell structure. They are mostly small in size and are found almost everywhere – in soil, in water, on our skin, in our intestines and even in pools of hot water in volcanic areas.
All cells have a cell membrane, but some cells, including prokaryotes, also have a cell wall outside the cell membrane. This is a much thicker and stronger structure than the membrane. It protects the cell, maintains its shape and prevents it from bursting. In prokaryotes the cell wall contains peptidoglycan. It is often referred to as being extracellular.
As no nucleus is present in a prokaryotic cell its interior is entirely lled with cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is not divided into compartments by membranes – it is one uninterrupted chamber. The structure is therefore simpler than in eukaryotic cells, though we must remember that it is still very complex in terms of the biochemicals that are present, including many enzymes.
Organelles are present in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells that are analogous to the organs of multi-cellular organisms in that they are distinct structures with specialized functions. Prokaryotes do not have cytoplasmic organelles apart from ribosomes. Their size, measured in Svedberg units (S) is 70S, which is smaller than those of eukaryotes.

1 . 2 u lt r A s t r u c t u r e o f c e l l s
Part of the cytoplasm appears lighter than the rest in many electron micrographs. This region contains the DNA of the cell, usually in the form of one circular DNA molecule. The DNA is not associated with proteins, which explains the lighter appearance compared with other parts of the cytoplasm that contain enzymes and ribosomes. This lighter area of the cell is called the nucleoid – meaning nucleus-like as it contains DNA but is not a true nucleus.
Cell division in prokaryotes Prokaryotes divide by binary ssion.
All living organisms need to produce new cells. They can only do this by division of pre-existing cells. Cell division in prokaryotic cells is called binary ssion and it is used for asexual reproduction. The single circular chromosome is replicated and the two copies of the chromosome move to opposite ends of the cell. Division of the cytoplasm of the cell quickly follows. Each of the daughter cells contains one copy of the chromosome so they are genetically identical.

Draw the ultrastructure of prokaryotic cells based on electron micrographs.
Because prokaryotes are mostly very small, their internal structure cannot be seen using a light microscope. It is only with much higher magnication in electron micrographs that we can see the details of the structure, called the ultrastructure. Drawings of the ultrastructure of prokaryotes are therefore based on electron micrographs.
Shown below and on the next page are two electron micrographs of E.coli, a bacterium found in our intestines. One of them is a thin section and shows the internal structure. The other has been prepared by a different technique and shows the external structure. A drawing of each is also shown. By comparing the drawings with the electron micrographs you can learn how to identify structures within prokaryotic cells.

Biologists sometimes use the term “bacteria” instead of “prokaryote”. This may not always be appropriate because the term prokaryote encompasses a larger group of organisms than true bacteria (Eubacteria). It also includes organisms in another group called the Archaea.

There is a group of photosynthetic organisms that used to be called blue-green algae, but their cell structure is prokaryotic and algae are eukaryotic. This problem has been solved by renaming them as Cyanobacteria.

Garlic cells store a harmless sulphur-containing compound called alliin in their vacuoles. They store an enzyme called alliinase in other parts of the cell. Alliinase converts alliin into a compound called allicin, which has a very strong smell and avour and is toxic to some herbivores. This reaction occurs when herbivores bite into garlic and damage cells, mixing the enzyme and its substrate. Perhaps surprisingly, many humans like the avour, but to get it garlic must be crushed or cut, not used whole.

Eukaryotic cell structure Eukaryotes have a compar tmentalized cell structure.
Eukaryotic cells have a much more complicated internal structure than prokaryotic cells. Whereas the cytoplasm of a prokaryotic cell is one undivided space, eukaryotic cells are compartmentalized. This means that they are divided up by partitions into compartments. The partitions are single or double membranes. The most important of these compartments is the nucleus. It contains the cell’s chromosomes. The compartments in the cytoplasm are known as organelles. Just as each organ in an animal’s body is specialized

to perform a particular role, each organelle in a eukaryotic cell has a distinctive structure and function.

There are several advantages in being compartmentalized:

●

Enzymes and substrates for a particular process can be much more concentrated than if they were spread throughout the cytoplasm.

●

Substances that could cause damage to the cell can be kept inside the membrane of an organelle. For example, the digestive enzymes of a lysosome could digest and kill a cell, if they were not safely stored inside the lysosome membrane.

●

Conditions such as pH can be maintained at an ideal level for a particular process, which may be different to the levels needed for other processes in a cell.

●

Organelles with their contents can be moved around within thecell.

The rER consists of attened membrane sacs, called cisternae. Attached to the outside of these cisternae are ribosomes. They are larger than in prokaryotes and are classied as 80S. The main function of the rER is to synthesize protein for secretion from the cell. Protein synthesized by the ribosomes of the rER passes into its cisternae and is then carried by vesicles, which bud o and are moved to the Golgi apparatus.

This organelle consists of attened membrane sacs called cisternae, like rER. However the cisternae are not as long, are often curved, do not have attached ribosomes and have many vesicles nearby. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins brought in vesicles from the rER. Most of these proteins are then carried in vesicles to the plasma membrane for secretion.
These are approximately spherical with a single membrane. They are formed from Golgi vesicles. They contain high concentrations of protein, which makes them densely staining in electron micrographs. They contain digestive enzymes, which can be used to break down ingested food in vesicles or break down organelles in the cell or even the whole cell.
A double membrane surrounds mitochondria, with the inner of these membranes invaginated to form structures called cristae. The uid inside is called the matrix. The shape of mitochondria is variable but is usually spherical or ovoid. They produce ATP for the cell by aerobic cell respiration. Fat is digested here if it is being used as an energy source in the cell.
These appear as dark granules in the cytoplasm and are not surrounded by a membrane. They have the same size as ribosomes attached to the rER – about 20nm in diameter, and known as 80S. Free ribosomes synthesize protein, releasing it to work in the cytoplasm, as enzymes or in other ways. Ribosomes are constructed in a region of the nucleus called the nucleolus.
A double membrane surrounds the chloroplast. Inside are stacks of thylakoids, which are attened sacs of membrane. The shape of chloroplasts is variable but is usually spherical or ovoid. They produce glucose and a wide variety of other organic compounds by photosynthesis. Starch grains may be present inside chloroplasts if they have been photosynthesizing rapidly.
These are organelles that consist simply of a single membrane with uid inside. Many plant cells have large vacuoles that occupy more than half of the cell volume. Some animals absorb foods from outside and digest them inside vacuoles. Some unicellular organisms use vacuoles to expel excess water. Vesicles are very small vacuoles used to transpor t materials inside the cell.

microtubule membrane

In the cytoplasm of cells there are small cylindrical bres called microtubules that have a variety of roles, including moving chromosomes during cell division. Animal cells have structures called centrioles, which consist of two groups of nine triple microtubules. Centrioles form an anchor point for microtubules during cell division and also for microtubules inside cilia and agella.
These are whip-like structures projecting from the cell surface. They contain a ring of nine double microtubules plus two central ones. Flagella are larger and usually only one is present, as in a sperm. Cilia are smaller and many are present. Cilia and agella can be used for locomotion. Cilia can be also be used to create a current in the uid next to the cell.

Gland cells secrete substances – they release them through their plasma membrane. There are two types of gland cells in the pancreas. Endocrine cells secrete hormones into the bloodstream. Exocrine gland cells in the pancreas secrete digestive enzymes into a duct that carries them to the small intestine where they digest foods.

Enzymes are proteins, so the exocrine gland cells have organelles needed to synthesize proteins in large quantities, process them to make them ready for secretion, transport them to the plasma membrane and then release them. The electron micrograph on the right shows these organelles:

Phospholipid bilayers Phospholipids form bilayers in water due to the amphipathic proper ties of phospholipid molecules.
Some substances are attracted to water – they are hydrophilic Other substances are not attracted to water – they are hydrophobic. Phospholipids are unusual because part of a phospholipid molecule is hydrophilic and part is hydrophobic. Substances with this property are described as amphipathic. The hydrophilic part of a phospholipid is the phosphate group. The hydrophobic part consists of two hydrocarbon chains. The chemical structure of phospholipids is shown in gure 1.
The structure can be represented simply using a circle for the phosphate group and two lines for the hydrocarbon chains.
▲ Figure 2 Simplied diagram of a phospholipid molecule
The two parts of the molecule are often called phosphate heads and hydrocarbon tails. When phospholipids are mixed with water the phosphate heads are attracted to the water but the hydrocarbon tails are attracted to each other, but not to water. Because of this the phospholipids become arranged into double layers, with the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails facing inwards towards each other and the hydrophilic heads facing the water on either side. These double layers are called phospholipid bilayers. They are stable structures and they form the basis of all cell membranes.

Using models as representations of the real world: there are alternative models of

membrane structure.
In the 1920s, Gorter and Grendel extracted phospholipids from the plasma membrane of red blood cells and calculated that the area that the phospholipids occupied when

arranged in a monolayer was twice as large as the area of plasma membrane. They deduced that the membrane contained a bilayer of phospholipids. There were several errors in

band between.Proteins appear dark in electron micrographs and phospholipids appear light, so this appearance tted the Davson-Danielli model.

Membranes also contain protein and Gorter and Grendel’s model did not explain where this is located. In the 1930s Davson and Danielli proposed layers of protein adjacent to the phospholipid bilayer, on both sides of the membrane. They proposed this sandwich model because they thought it would explain how membranes, despite being very thin, are a very effective barrier to the movement of some substances. High magnication electron micrographs of membranes were made in the 1950s, which showed a railroad track appearance – two dark lines with a lighter

Another model of membrane structure was proposed in 1966 by Singer and Nicolson. In this model the proteins occupy a variety of positions in the membrane. Peripheral proteins are attached to the inner or outer surface. Integral proteins are embedded in the phospholipid bilayer, in some cases with parts protruding out from the bilayer on one or both sides. The proteins are likened to the tiles in a mosaic. Because the phospholipid molecules are free to move in each of the two layers of the bilayer, the proteins are also able to move. This gives the model its name – the uid mosaic model.

Falsication of theories with one theory being superseded by another: evidence falsied the Davson–Danielli model.
The Davson–Danielli model of membrane structure was accepted by most cell biologists for about 30 years. Results of many experiments tted the model including X-ray diffraction studies and electron microscopy.

In the 1950s and 60s some experimental evidence accumulated that did not t with the Davson– Danielli model:

●

Freeze-etched electron micrographs. This technique involves rapid freezing of cells and then fracturing them. The fracture occurs along lines of weakness, including the centre of membranes. Globular structures scattered through freeze-etched images of the centre of membranes were interpreted as transmembrane proteins.

●

Structure of membrane proteins. Improvements in biochemical techniques allowed proteins to be extracted from membranes. They were found to be very varied in size and globular in shape so were unlike the type of structural protein that would form continuous layers on the

periphery of the membrane. Also the proteins were hydrophobic on at least part of their surface so they would be attracted to the hydrocarbon tails of the phospholipids in the centre of the membrane.

●

Fluorescent antibody tagging. Red or green uorescent markers were attached to antibodies that bind to membrane proteins. The membrane proteins of some cells were tagged with red markers and other cells with green markers. The cells were fused together. Within 40 minutes the red and green markers were mixed throughout the membrane of the fused cell. This showed that membrane proteins are free to move within the membrane rather than being xed in a peripheral layer.

Taken together, this experimental evidence falsied the Davson–Danielli model. A

replacement was needed that tted the evidence and the model that became widely accepted was the Singer–Nicolson uid mosaic model. It has been the leading model for over fty years but it would be unwise to assume that it will never be superseded. There are already some suggested modications of the model.
An important maxim for scientists is “Think it possible that you might be mistaken.” Advances in science happen because scientists reject dogma and instead search continually for better understanding.

They attached uorescent markers to membrane proteins – green markers to mouse cells and red markers to human cells. In both cases, spherical cells growing in tissue culture were used. The marked mouse and human cells were then fused together. At rst, the fused cells had one green hemisphere and one red one, but over the minutes following fusion, the red and green markers gradually merged, until they were completely mixed throughout the whole of the cell membrane. Blocking of ATP production did not prevent this mixing (ATP supplies energy for active processes in the cell).

Membrane proteins
Membrane proteins are diverse in terms of structure, position in the membrane and function.
Cell membranes have a wide range of functions. The primary function is to form a barrier through which ions and hydrophilic molecules cannot easily pass. This is carried out by the phospholipid bilayer. Almost all other functions are carried out by proteins in the membrane. Six examples are listed in table 1.

Because of these varied functions, membrane proteins are very diverse in structure and in their position in the membrane. They can be divided into two groups.

●

Integral proteins are hydrophobic on at least part of their surface and they are therefore embedded in the hydrocarbon chains in the centre of the membrane. Many integral proteins are transmembrane – they extend across the membrane, with hydrophilic parts projecting through the regions of phosphate heads on either side.

30

1.3 MeMbrAne structure

●

Peripheral proteins are hydrophilic on their surface, so are not embedded in the membrane. Most of them are attached to the surface of integral proteins and this attachment is often reversible. Some have a single hydrocarbon chain attached to them which is inserted into the membrane, anchoring the protein to the membrane surface.

Figure 9 includes examples of both types of membrane protein.

Membranes all have an inner face and an outer face and membrane proteins are orientated so that they can carry out their function correctly. For example, pump proteins in the plasma membranes of root cells in plants are orientated so that they pick up potassium ions from the soil and pump them into the root cell.

The protein content of membranes is very variable, because the function of membranes varies. The more active a membrane, the higher is its protein content. Membranes in the myelin sheath around nerve bres just act as insulators and have a protein content of only 18 %.

The protein content of most plasma membranes on the outside of the cell is about 50%. The highest protein contents are in the membranes of chloroplasts and mitochondria, which are active in photosynthesis and respiration. These have protein contents of about 75 %

Identify which each component in the diagramis.

Using similar symbols to represent the components draw the structure of a membrane, according to the uid mosaic model, that contains these proteins: channels for facilitated diffusion, pumps for active transport, immobilized enzymes and receptors for hormones or neurotransmitters.

It is worth thinking about what you have been doing when you draw the uid mosaic model of membrane structure. Drawings simplify and interpret a structure or process. They are used in science as visual explanations. They show our understanding of a structure or process and not merely what it looks like. Drawings are based on models, hypotheses or theories. For example, when we show an animal tissue as a group of cells with lines to represent the plasma membranes, we are basing our drawing on the cell theory.

A diagram in a book or scientic paper usually starts out as a drawingon paper by the author, which is tidied up to make it suitable for printing. It is now possible to use computer software, but a pencil and paper are perhaps still the best way to draw. No artistic ability is needed for scientic drawing, and all biologists can develop and improve their drawing skills. Of course some biologists produce particularly good drawings. Some examples are shown in gure 10.

Cholesterol is a type of lipid, but it is not a fat or oil. Instead it belongs

to a group of substances called steroids. Most of a cholesterol molecule

is hydrophobic so it is attracted to the hydrophobic hydrocarbon

tails in the centre of the membrane, but one end of the cholesterol

molecule has a hydroxyl (

OH) group which is hydrophilic. This is

attracted to the phosphate heads on the periphery of the membrane.

Cholesterol molecules are therefore positioned between phospholipids

The amount of cholesterol in animal cell membranes varies. In the membranes of vesicles that hold neurotransmitters at synapses as much of 30% of the lipid in the membrane is cholesterol.

1.4 MeMbrAne trAnsPor t
The role of cholesterol in membranes
Cholesterol in mammalian membranes reduces membrane uidity and permeability to some solutes.
Cell membranes do not correspond exactly to any of the three states of matter. The hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails usually behave as a liquid, but the hydrophilic phosphate heads act more like a solid. Overall the membrane is uid as components of the membrane are free to move. The uidity of animal cell membranes needs to be carefully controlled. If they were too uid they would be less able to control what substances pass through, but if they were not uid enough the movement of the cell and substances within it would be restricted. Cholesterol disrupts the regular packing of the hydrocarbon tails of phospholipid molecules, so prevents them crystallizing and behaving as a solid. However it also restricts molecular motion and therefore the uidity of the membrane. It also reduces the permeability to hydrophilic particles such as sodium ions and hydrogen ions. Due to its shape cholesterol can help membranes to curve into a concave shape, which helps in the formation of vesicles during endocytosis.

Endocytosis The uidity of membranes allows materials to be taken

into cells by endocytosis or released by exocytosis.
A vesicle is a small sac of membrane with a droplet of uid inside. Vesicles are spherical and are normally present in eukaryotic cells. They are a very dynamic feature of cells. They are constructed, moved around and then deconstructed. This can happen because of the uidity of membranes, which allows structures surrounded by a membrane to change shape and move.

To form a vesicle, a small region of a membrane is pulled from the rest of the membrane and is pinched off. Proteins in the membrane carry out this process, using energy from ATP.

Vesicles can be formed by pinching off a small piece of the plasma membrane of cells. The vesicle is formed on the inside of the plasma membrane. It contains material that was outside the cell, so this is a method of taking materials into the cell. It is called endocytosis. Figure 1 shows how the process occurs.

vesicle ▲ Figure 1 Endocytosis

Vesicles taken in b y e ndo cy tos i s co nta i n wat e r a n d so lu t e s f ro m outside the cell but they also often contain larger molecules needed by the cell that cannot pass across the plasma membrane. For example, in the p l a ce nta , p ro te ins fr om t h e mot h er ’s bl ood , including antibodies, are absorbed into the fetus by endocytosis. Some cells take in large undigested food particles by endocytosis. This happens in unicellular organisms including Amoeba and Paramecium. Some types of white blood cells take in pathogens including bacteria and viruses by end o cy tos i s a nd then kil l t h e m , a s p ar t o f t h e b ody’s response to infection.

34

Vesicle movement in cells
Vesicles move materials within cells.
Vesicles can be used to move materials around inside cells. In some cases it is the contents of the vesicle that need to be moved. In other cases it is proteins in the membrane of the vesicle that are the reason for vesicle movement.
An example of moving the vesicle contents occurs in secretory cells. Protein is synthesized by ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) a nd a ccumul ate s insi de th e r E R. Ves i c le s c o nt a i ni n g the proteins bud off the rER and carry them to the Golgi apparatus. The vesicles fuse with the Golgi apparatus, which processes the protein into its nal form. When this has been done, vesicles bud off the Golgi apparatus and move to the plasma membrane, where the protein is secreted.
In a growing cell, the area of the plasma membrane needs to increase. Phospholipids are synthesized next to the rER and become inserted into the rER membrane. Ribosomes on the rER synthesize membrane proteins which also become inserted into the membrane. Vesicles bud off the rER and move to the plasma membrane. They fuse with it, each

increasing the area of the plasma membrane by a very small amount. This method can also be used to increase the size of organelles in the cytoplasm such as lysosomes and mitochondria.

Exocytosis

The uidity of membranes allows materials to be taken into cells by endocytosis or released by exocytosis.
Vesicles can be used to release materials from cells. If a vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane, the contents are then outside the membrane and therefore outside the cell. This process is called exocytosis.

Digestive enzymes are released from gland cells by exocytosis. The polypeptides in the enzymes are synthesized by the rER, processed in the Golgi apparatus and then carried to the membrane in vesicles for exocytosis. In this case the release is referred to as secretion, because a useful substance is being released, not a waste product.

cell interior ▲ Figure 3 Exocytosis

Exocytosis can also be used to expel waste products or unwanted materials. An example is the removal of excess water from the cells of unicellular organisms. The water is loaded into a vesicle, sometimes called a contractile vacuole, which is then moved to the plasma membrane for expulsion by exocytosis. This can be seen quite easily in Paramecium, using a microscope. Figure 4 shows a drawing of Paramecium showing a contractile vesicle at each end of the cell.

contractile vesicle

Simple diusion
Par ticles move across membranes by simple diusion, facilitated diusion, osmosis and active transpor t.
Simple diffusion is one of the four methods of moving particles across membranes.
Diffusion is the spreading out of particles in liquids and gases that happens because the particles are in continuous random motion. More particles move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration than move in the opposite direction. There is therefore a net movement from the higher to the lower concentration – a movement down the concentration gradient. Living

organisms do not have to use energy to make diffusion occur so it is a passive process.
Simple diffusion across membranes involves particles passing between the phospholipids in the membrane. It can only happen if the phospholipid bilayer is permeable to the particles. Non-polar particles such as oxygen can diffuse through easily. If the oxygen concentration inside a cell is reduced due to aerobic respiration and the concentration outside is higher, oxygen will pass into the cell through the plasma membrane by passive diffusion. An example is shown in gure 6.

▲ Figure 5 Model of diusion with dots representing par ticles
The centre of membranes is hydrophobic, so ions with positive or negative charges cannot easily pass through. Polar molecules, which have partial positive and negative charges over their surface, can diffuse at low rates between the phospholipids of the membrane. Small polar particles such as urea or ethanol pass through more easily than largeparticles.

Facilitated diusion
Par ticles move across membranes by simple diusion, facilitated diusion, osmosis and active transpor t.
Facilitated diffusion is one of the four methods of moving particles across membranes. Ions and other particles that cannot diffuse between phospholipids can pass into or out of cells if there are channels for them through the plasma membrane. These channels are holes with a very narrow diameter. The walls of the channel consist of protein. The diameter and chemical properties of the channel ensure that only one type of particle passes through, for example sodium ions, or potassium ions, but not both. Because these channels help particles to pass through the membrane, from a higher concentration to a lower concentration, the process is called facilitated diffusion. Cells can control which types of channel are synthesized and placed in the plasma membrane and in this way they can control which substances diffuse in and out. Figure 8 shows the structure of a channel for magnesium ions, viewed from the side and from the outside of the membrane. The structure of the protein making up the channel ensures that only magnesium ions are able to pass through the hole in the centre.

Water is able to move in and out of most cells freely. Sometimes the number of water molecules moving in and out is the same and there is no net movement, but at other times more molecules move in one direction or the other. This net movement is osmosis.
Osmosis is due to differences in the concentration of substances dissolved in water (solutes). Substances dissolve by forming intermolecular bonds with water molecules. These bonds restrict the movement of the water molecules. Regions with a higher solute concentration therefore have a lower concentration of water molecules free to move than regions with a lower solute concentration. Because of this there is a net movement of water from regions of lower solute concentration to regions with higher solute concentration. This movement is passive because no energy has to be expended directly to make it occur.
Osmosis can happen in all cells because water molecules, despite being hydrophilic, are small enough to pass though the phospholipid bilayer. Some cells have water channels called aquaporins, which greatly increase membrane permeability to water. Examples are kidney cells that reabsorb water and root hair cells that absorb water from the soil.
At its narrowest point, the channel in an aquaporin is only slightly wider than water molecules, which therefore pass through in single le. Positive charges
+ at this point in the channel prevent protons (H ) from passing through.

Active transport

Par ticles move across membranes by simple diusion, facilitated diusion, osmosis and active transpor t.
Active transport is one of the four methods of moving particles across membranes.

Cells sometimes take in substances, even though there is already a higher concentration inside than outside. The substance is absorbed against the concentration gradient. Less commonly, cells sometimes pump substances out, even though there is already a larger concentration outside.

This type of movement across membranes is not diffusion and energy is needed to carry it out. It is therefore called active transport. Most active transport uses a substance called ATP as the energy supply for this process. Every cell produces its own supply of ATP by cell respiration.

Active transport is carried out by globular proteins in membranes, usually called pump proteins. The membranes of cells contain many different pump proteins allowing the cell to control the content of its cytoplasm precisely.

Figure 10 illustrates how a pump protein works. The molecule or ion

enters the pump protein and can reach as far as a central chamber. A

conformational change to the protein takes place using energy from

ATP. After this, the ion or molecule can pass to the opposite side of the

membrane and the pump protein returns to its original conformation.

Active transport of sodium and potassium in axons

Structure and function of sodium–potassium pumps for active transpor t.

An axon is part of a neuron (nerve cell) and consists of a tubular membrane with cytoplasm inside. Axons can be as narrow as one micrometre in diameter, but as long as one metre. Their function is to convey messages rapidly from one part of the body to another in an electrical form called a nerve impulse.
A nerve impulse involves rapid movements of sodium and then potassium ions across the axon membrane. These movements occur by facilitated diffusion through sodium and potassium channels. They occur because of concentration gradients between the inside and outside of the axon. The concentration gradients are built up by active transport, carried out by a sodium– potassium pump protein.

The sodium–potassium pump follows a repeating cycle of steps that result in three sodium ions being pumped out of the axon and two potassium ions being pumped in. Each time the pump goes round this cycle it uses one ATP. The cycle consists of these steps:

1

The interior of the pump is open to the inside

of the axon; three sodium ions enter the

pump and attach to their binding sites.

2

ATP transfers a phosphate group from itself

to the pump; this causes the pump to change

shape and the interior is then closed.

3

The interior of the pump opens to the

outside of the axon and the three sodium

ions are released.

Two potassium ions from outside can then

open to the inside of the axon.

Facilitated diusion of potassium in axons

Structure and function of sodium–potassium pumps for active transpor t and

potassium channels for facilitated diusion in axons.

A nerve impulse involves rapid movements of sodium and then potassium ions across the axon membrane. These movements occur by facilitated diffusion through sodium and potassium channels. Potassium channels will be described here as a special example of facilitated diffusion. Each potassium channel consists of four protein subunits with a narrow pore between them that allows potassium ions to pass in either direction. The pore is 0.3 nm wide at its narrowest.

Potassium ions are slightly smaller than 0.3 nm, but when they dissolve they become bonded to a shell of water molecules that makes them too large to pass thr o ug h the po re . To p a ss through, the bonds between the potassium ion and the surrounding water molecules are broken and bonds form temporarily between the ion and a series of amino acids in the narrowest part of the pore. After the potassium ion has passed through this part of the pore,

40

1.4 MeMbrAne trAnsPor t

it can again become associated with a shell of watermolecules.
Other positively charged ions that we might expect to pass through the pore are either too large to t through or are too small to form bonds with the amino acids in the narrowest part of the pore, so they cannot shed their shell of water molecules. This explains the specicity of the pump.
Potassium channels in axons are voltage gated. Voltages across membranes are due to an imbalance of positive and negative charges across the membrane. If an axon has relatively more

positive charges outside than inside, potassium channels are closed. At one stage during a nerve impulse there are relatively more positive charges inside. This causes potassium channels to open, allowing potassium ions to diffuse through. However, the channel rapidly closes again. This seems to be due to an extra globular protein subunit or ball, attached by a exible chain of amino acids. The ball can t inside the open pore, which it does within milliseconds of the pore opening. The ball remains in place until the potassium channel returns to its original closed state. This is shown in gure 13.

Estimation of osmolarity in tissues by bathing samples in hypotonic and

hyper tonic solutions.

Osmosis is due to solutes that form bonds with water. These solutes are osmotically active. Glucose, sodium ions, potassium ions and chloride ions are all osmotically active and solutions of them are often used in osmosis experiments. Cells contain many different osmotically active solutes.
The osmolarity of a solution is the total concentration of osmotically active solutes. The

units for measuring it are osmoles or milliosmoles (mOsm). The normal osmolarity of human tissue is about 300 mOsm.
An isotonic solution has the same osmolarity as a tissue. A hypertonic solution has a higher osmolarity and a hypotonic solution has a lower osmolarity. If samples of a tissue are bathed in hypertonic and hypotonic solutions, and

Experimental design: accurate quantitative measurements in osmosis experiments are essential.
An ideal experiment gives results that have only one reasonable interpretation. Conclusions can be drawn from the results without any doubts or uncertainties. In most experiments there are some doubts and uncertainties, but if the design of an experiment is rigorous, these can be minimized. The experiment then provides strong evidence for or against a hypothesis.

This checklist can be used when designing an experiment:

●

Results should if possible be quantitative as these give stronger evidence than descriptive results.

●

Measurements should be as accurate as possible, using the most appropriate and best quality meters or other apparatus.

●

Repeats are needed, because however accurately quantitative measurements are taken biological samples are variable.

●

All factors that might affect the results of the experiment must be controlled, with only the factors under investigation being allowed to vary and all other factors remaining constant.

After doing an experiment the design can be evaluated using this checklist. The evaluation might lead to improvements to the design that would have made the experiment more rigorous.

If you have done an osmosis experiment in which samples of plant tissue are bathed in solutions of varying solute concentration, you can evaluate its design. If you did repeats for each concentration of solution, and the results were very similar to each other, your results were probably reliable.

▲ Figure 16 Replicates are needed for each treatment in a rigorous experiment

Designing osmosis experiments

Rigorous experimental design is needed to produce reliable results: how can accurate quantitative measurements be obtained in osmosis experiments?
The osmolarity of plant tissues can be investigated in many ways. Figure 17 shows some red onion cells that had been placed in a sodium chloride solution. The following method can be used to observe the consequences of osmosis in red onion cells.

1

Peel off some epidermis from the scale of a red onion bulb.

2

Cut out a sample of it, about 5 × 5mm.

3

Mount the sample in a drop of distilled water on a microscope

slide, with a cover slip.

▲ Figure 17 Micrograph of red onion cells placed in salt solution

Observe using a microscope. The cytoplasm should ll the space

inside the cell wall, with the plasma membrane pushed up against it.

5

Mount another sample of epidermis in sodium chloride solutions

with concentration of 0.5mol dm

3 or 3%. If water leaves the cells

by osmosis and the volume of cytoplasm is reduced, the plasma

membrane pulls away from the cell wall, as shown in Figure17.

Plant cells with their membranes pulled away from their cell walls

are plasmolysed and the process is plasmolysis.

This method can be used to help design an experiment to nd out the osmolarity of onion cells or other cells in which the area occupied by the cytoplasm can easily be seen. The checklist in the previous section can be used to try to ensure that the design is rigorous.

Preventing osmosis in excised tissues and organs

Tissues or organs to be used in medical procedures must be bathed in a solution

with the same osmolarity as the cytoplasm to prevent osmosis.

Animal cells can be damaged by osmosis. Figure 18 shows blood cells that have been

bathed in solutions with (a) the same osmolarity, (b) higher osmolarity and (c) lower osmolarity.

a)

▲ Figure 18 Blood cells bathed in solutions of dierent solute concentration

In a solution with higher osmolarity (a hypertonic solution), water leaves the cells by osmosis so their cytoplasm shrinks in volume. The area of plasma membrane does not change, so it develops indentations, which are sometimes called crenellations. In a solution with lower osmolarity (hypotonic), the cells take in water by osmosis and swell up. They may eventually burst, leaving ruptured plasma membranes called red cell ghosts.
Both hypertonic and hypotonic solutions therefore damage human cells, but in a solution with same osmolarity as the cells (isotonic), water molecules enter and leave the cells at the same rate so they remain healthy. It is therefore important for any human tissues and organs to be bathed in an isotonic solution during medical procedures. Usually an isotonic sodium chloride solution is

used, which is called normal saline. It has an osmolarity of about 300 mOsm (milliOsmoles).

Normal saline is used in many medical procedures. It can be:

●

safely introduced to a patient’s blood system via an intravenous drip.

●

used to rinse wounds and skin abrasions.

●

used to keep areas of damaged skin moistened prior to skin grafts.

●

used as the basis for eye drops.

●

frozen to the consistency of slush for packing hearts, kidneys and other donor organs that have to be transported to the hospital where the transplant operation is to be done.

existing cell divided in two. Before that all of the genetic material in the nucleus was copied so that both cells formed by cell division had a nucleus with a full complement of genes. We can trace the origin of cells in the body back to the rst cell – the zygote that was the start of our lives, produced by the fusion of a sperm and an egg.
Sperm and egg cells were produced by cell division in our parents. We can trace the origins of all cells in our parents’ bodies back to the zygote from which they developed, and then continue this process over the generations of our human ancestors. If we accept that humans evolved from pre-existing ancestral species, we can trace the origins of cells back through hundreds of millions of years to the earliest cells on Earth. There is therefore a continuity of life from its origins on Earth to the cells in our bodies today.
In 2010 there were reports that biologists had created the rst articial cell, but this cell was not entirely new. The base sequence of the DNA of a bacterium (Mycoplasma mycoides) was synthesized articially, with a few deliberate changes. This DNA was transferred to pre-existing cells of a different type of bacterium ( Mycoplasma capricolum), which was effectively converted into Mycoplasma mycoides. This process was therefore an extreme form of genetic modication and the creation of entirely new cells remains an insuperable challenge at the moment.

Spontaneous generation and the origin of cells

Verifying the general principles that underlie the natural world: the principle that

cells only come from pre-existing cells needs to be veried.

Spontaneous generation is the formation of living organisms from non-living matter. The Greek philosopher and botanist Theophrastus reported that a plant called Silphium had sprung up from soil where it was not previously present and described this as an example of spontaneous generation. Aristotle wrote about insects being formed from the dew falling on leaves or from the hair, esh or faeces of animals. In the 16th century the GermanSwiss botanist and astrologer Paracelsus quoted observations of spontaneous generation of mice, frogs and eels from water, air or decaying matter.
It is easy to see how ideas of spontaneous generation could have persisted when cells and microorganisms had not been discovered and the nature of sexual reproduction was not understood. From the 17th century onwards biologists carried out experiments to test the theory that life could arise from non-living matter. Francesco Redi showed that maggots only developed in rotting meat if ies were allowed to come into contact with it. Lazzaro Spallanzani boiled soup in eight containers, then sealed four of them and left the others open to the air. Organisms grew in the containers left open but not in the others.

Some biologists remained convinced that spontaneous generation could occur if there was access to the a i r. L oui s Pa s te ur re s pon d ed by carrying out carefully designed experiments with swan-necked asks, which established beyond reasonable doubt that spontaneous generation of life d o e s not no w o ccur. Pa ste u r ’s experiments are described in the next section of this sub-topic.

Apart from the evidence from the experiments of Pasteur and others, there are other reasons for biologists universally accepting that cells only come from pre-existing cells:

●

A cell is a highly complex structure and no natural mechanism has been suggested for producing cells from simpler subunits.

●

No example is known of increases in the number of cells in a population, organism or tissue without cell division occurring.

●

Viruses are produced from simpler subunits but they do not consist of cells, and they can only be produced inside the host cells that they have infected.

Spontaneous generation and Pasteur ’s experiments

Evidence from Pasteur ’s experiments that spontaneous generation of cells and

organisms does not now occur on Ear th.
Louis Pasteur made a nutrient broth by boiling water containing yeast and sugar. He showed that if this broth was kept in a sealed ask, it remained unchanged, and no fungi or other organisms appeared. He then passed air though a pad of cotton wool in a tube, to lter out microscopic particles from the air, including bacteria and the spores of fungi. If the pad of cotton wool was placed in broth in a sealed ask, within 36 hours, there were large number of microorganisms in the broth and mould grew over its surface.
The most famous of Pasteur’s experiments involved the use of swan-necked asks. He placed samples of broth in asks with long necks and

then melted the glass of the necks and bent it into a variety of shapes, shown in gure 3.
Pasteur then boiled the broth in some of the asks to kill any organisms present but left others unboiled as controls. Fungi and other organisms soon appeared in the unboiled asks but not in the boiled ones, even after long periods of time. The broth in the asks was in contact with air, which it had been suggested was needed for spontaneous generation, yet no spontaneous generation occurred. Pasteur snapped the necks of some of the asks to leave a shorter vertical neck. Organisms were soon apparent in these asks and decomposed the broth.

47

CELL BIOLOGY

Pasteur published his results in 1860 and subsequently repeated them with other liquids including urine and milk, with the same results. He concluded that the swan necks prevented organisms

from the air getting into the broth or other liquids and that no organisms appeared spontaneously. His experiments convinced most biologists, both at the time of publication and since then.

▲ Figure 3 Drawings of Pasteur ’s swan-necked asks

Origin of the rst cells
The rst cells must have arisen from non-living material.
If we trace back the ancestry of cells over billions of years, we must eventually reach the earliest cells to have existed. These were the rst living things on Earth. Unless cells arrived on Earth from somewhere else in the universe, they must have arisen from non-living material. This is a logical conclusion, but it gives perhaps the hardest question of all for biologists to answer: how could a structure as complex as the cell have arisen by natural means from non-living material?
It has sometimes been argued that complex structures cannot arise by evolution, but there is evidence that this can happen in a series of stages over long periods of time. Living cells may have evolved over hundreds of millions of years. There are hypotheses for how some of the main stages could have occurred.

1. Production of carbon compounds such as sugars and amino acids

2. Assembly of carbon compounds into polymers

Stanley Miller and Harold Urey passed steam through a mixture of methane, hydrogen and ammonia. The mixture was thought to be representative of the atmosphere of the early Earth. Electrical discharges were used to simulate lightning. They found that amino acids and other carbon compounds needed for life were produced.

A possible site for the origin of the rst carbon compounds is around deep-sea vents. These are cracks in the Earth’s surface, characterized by gushing hot water carrying reduced inorganic chemicals such as iron sulphide. These chemicals represent readily accessible supplies of energy, a source of energy for the assembly of these carbon compounds into polymers.

3. Formation of membranes If phospholipids or other amphipathic carbon compounds were among the rst carbon compounds, they would have naturally assembled into bilayers. Experiments have shown that these bilayers readily form vesicles resembling the plasma membrane of a small cell. This would have allowed different internal chemistry from that of the surroundings to develop.

4. Development of a mechanism for inheritance
Living organisms currently have genes made of DNA and use enzy me s a s ca tal ys ts . To r ep li c a t e DNA and be able to pass genes on to offspring, enzymes are need e d . Ho we ve r, for e n z ym e s t o be made, genes are needed. The solution to this conundrum may have been an earlier phase in evolution when RNA was the genetic material. It can store information in the same way as DNA but it is both self-replicating and can itself act as a catalyst.

▲ Figure 6 Liposomes

Endosymbiosis and eukaryotic cells
The origin of eukaryotic cells can be explained by the endosymbiotic theory.
The theory of endosymbiosis helps to explain the evolution of eukaryotic cells. It states that mitochondria were once free-living prokaryotic organisms that had developed the process of aerobic cell respiration. Larger prokaryotes that could only respire anaerobically took them in by endocytosis. Instead of killing and digesting the smaller prokaryotes they allowed them to continue to live in their cytoplasm. As long as the smaller prokaryotes grew and divided as fast as the larger ones, they could persist indenitely inside the larger cells. According to the theory of endosymbiosis they have persisted over hundreds of millions of years of evolution to become the mitochondria inside eukaryotic cells today.
The larger prokaryotes and the smaller aerobically respiring ones were in a symbiotic relationship in which both of them beneted. This is known as a mutualistic relationship. The smaller cell would have been supplied with food by the larger one. The smaller cell would have carried out aerobic respiration to supply energy efciently to the larger cell. Natural selection therefore favoured cells that had developed this endosymbiotic relationship.
The endosymbiotic theory also explains the origin of chloroplasts. If a prokaryote that had developed photosynthesis was taken in by a larger cell and was allowed to survive, grow and divide, it could have developed into the chloroplasts of photosynthetic eukaryotes. Again, both of the organisms in the endosymbiotic relationship would havebeneted.

Although no longer capable of living independently, chloroplasts and mitochondria both have features that suggest they evolved from independent prokaryotes:

●

They have their own genes, on a circular DNA molecule like that of prokaryotes.

●

They have their own 70S ribosomes of a size and shape typical of some prokaryotes.

●

They transcribe their DNA and use the mRNA to synthesize some of their own proteins.

The role of mitosis

Mitosis is division of the nucleus into two genetically identical daughter nuclei.
The nucleus of a eukaryotic cell can divide to form two genetically identical nuclei by a process called mitosis. Mitosis allows the cell to divide into two daughter cells, each with one of the nuclei and therefore genetically identical to the other.

Before mitosis can occur, all of the DNA in the nucleus must be replicated. This happens during interphase, the period before mitosis. Each chromosome is converted from a single DNA molecule into two identical DNA molecules, called chromatids. During mitosis, one of these chromatids passes to each daughter nucleus.

Mitosis is involved whenever cells with genetically identical nuclei are required in eukaryotes: during embryonic development, growth, tissue repair and asexual reproduction.

Although mitosis is a continuous process, cytologists have divided the events into four phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. The events that occur in these phases are described in a later section of this sub-topic.

CELL BIOLOGY

Ai viy There is a limit to how many times most cells in an organism can undergo mitosis. Cells taken from a human embryo will only divide between 40 and 60 times, but given that the number of cells doubles with each division, it is easily enough to produce an adult human body. There are exceptions where much greater numbers of divisions can occur, such as the germinal epithelium in the testes. This is a layer of cells that divides to provide cells used in sperm production. Discuss how many times the cells in this layer might need to divide during a man's life.

Interphase

Interphase is a very active phase of the cell cycle with
many processes occurring in the nucleus and cytoplasm.
The cell cycle is the sequence of events between one cell division and the next. It has two main phases: interphase and cell division. Interphase is a very active phase in the life of a cell when many m e t a b o l i c r e a c t i o n s o c c u r. S o m e o f t h e s e , s u c h a s t h e r e a c t i o n s o f cell respiration, also occur during cell division, but DNA replication in the nucleus and protein synthesis in the cytoplasm only happen during interphase.

During interphase the numbers of mitochondria in the cytoplasm increase. This is due to the growth and division of mitochondria. In plant cells and algae the numbers of chloroplasts increase in the same way. They also synthesize cellulose and use vesicles to add it to their cell walls.

Interphase consists of three phases, the G

phase, S phase and G

phase.

In the S phase the cell replicates all the genetic material in its nucleus, so

that after mitosis both the new cells have a complete set of genes. Some

do not progress beyond G , because they are never going to divide so do 1

not need to prepare for mitosis. They enter a phase called G

which may

Supercoiling of chromosomes
Chromosomes condense by supercoiling during mitosis.
During mitosis, the two chromatids that make up each chromosome must be separated and moved to opposite poles of the cell. The DNA molecules in these chromosomes are immensely long. Human nuclei are on average less than 5 µm in diameter but DNA molecules in them are more than 50,000 µm long. It is therefore essential to package chromosomes into much shorter structures. This process is known as condensation of chromosomes and it occurs during the rst stage of mitosis.
Condensation occurs by means repeatedly coiling the DNA molecule to make the chromosome shorter and wider. This process is called supercoiling. Proteins called histones that are associated with DNA in eukaryote chromosomes help with supercoiling and enzymes are also involved.

Phases of mitosis

Identication of phases of mitosis in cells viewed with a microscope.

There are large numbers of dividing cells in the tips of growing roots. If root tips are treated chemically to allow the cells to be separated, they can be squashed to form a single layer of cells on a microscope slide. Stains that bind to DNA are used to make the chromosomes visible and stages of mitosis can then be observed using a microscope.

To be able to identify the four stages of mitosis, it is necessary to understand what is happening in them. After studying the information in this section you should be able to observe dividing cells using a microscope or in a micrograph and assign them to one of the phases.

Prophase

The chromosomes become shor ter and fatter by coiling. To become shor t enough they have to coil repeatedly. This is called supercoiling. The nucleolus breaks down. Microtubules grow from structures called microtubule organizing centres (MTOC) to form a spindle-shaped array that links the poles of the cell. At the end of prophase the nuclear membrane breaks down

Metaphase

Microtubules continue to grow and attach to the centromeres on each chromosome. The two attachment points on opposite sides of each centromere allow the chromatids of a chromosome to attach to microtubules from dierent poles. The microtubules are all put under tension to test whether the attachment is correct. This happens by shortening of the microtubules at the centromere. If the attachment is correct, the chromosomes remain on the equator of the cell.

▲ Metaphase – chromosomes aligned on the equator and not inside a nuclear membrane

Anaphase

At the star t of anaphase, each centromere divides, allowing the pairs of sister chromatids to separate. The spindle microtubules pull them rapidly towards the poles of the cell. Mitosis produces two genetically identical nuclei because sister chromatids are pulled to opposite poles. This is ensured by the way that the spindle microtubules were attached in metaphase.

The mitotic index

Determination of a mitotic index from a micrograph.

The mitotic index is the ratio between the number of cells in mitosis in a tissue and the total number of observed cells. It can be calculated using this equation:

Mitotic

index

=

number of cells in mitosis ___

total number of cells

Figure 4 is a micrograph of cells from a tumour that has developed from a Leydig cell in the testis. The mitotic index for this tumour can be calculated if the total number of cells in the micrograph is counted and also the number of cells in meiosis.

To nd the mitotic index of the part of a root tip where cells are proliferating rapidly, these instructions can be used:

●

Obtain a prepared slide of an onion or garlic root tip. Find andexamine the meristematic region, i.e. a region of rapid celldivision.

●

Create a tally chart. Classify each of about a hundred cells in this region as being either in interphase or in any of the stages of mitosis.

●

Use this data to calculate the mitotic index.

Figure 4 Cells undergoing mitosis in a Leydig cell tumour

Cytokinesis

Cytokinesis occurs after mitosis and is dierent in plant and animal cells.
Cells can divide after mitosis when two genetically identical nuclei are present in a cell. The process of cell division is called cytokinesis. It usually begins before mitosis has actually been completed and it happens in a different way in plant and animal cells.

In animal cells the plasma membrane is pulled inwards around the equator of the cell to form a cleavage furrow. This is accomplished using a ring of contractile protein immediately inside the plasma membrane at the equator. The proteins are actin and myosin and are similar to proteins that cause contraction in muscle. When the cleavage furrow reaches the centre, the cell is pinched apart into two daughter cells.

In plant cells vesicles are moved to the equator where they fuse to form tubular structures across the equator. With the fusion of more vesicles these tubular structures merge to form two layers of membrane across the whole of the equator, which develop into the plasma membranes of the two daughter cells and are connected to the existing plasma membranes at the sides of the cell, completing the division of the cytoplasm.

The next stage in plants is for pectins and other substances to be brought in vesicles and deposited by exocytosis between the two new membranes. This forms the middle lamella that will link the new cell walls. Both of the daughter cells then bring cellulose to the equator and deposit it by exocytosis adjacent to the middle lamella. As a result, each cell builds its own cell wall adjacent to the equator.

CELL BIOLOGY

Cyclins and the control of the cell cycle
Cyclins are involved in the control of the cell cycle.
Each of the phases of the cell cycle involves many important tasks. A group of proteins called cyclins is used to ensure that tasks are performed at the correct time and that the cell only moves on to the next stage of the cycle when it is appropriate.
Cyclins bind to enzymes called cyclin-dependent kinases. These kinases then become active and attach phosphate groups to other proteins in the cell. The attachment of phosphate triggers the other proteins to become active and carry out tasks specic to one of the phases of the cell cycle.
There are four main types of cyclin in human cells. The graph in gure6 shows how the levels of these cyclins rise and fall. Unless these cyclins reach a threshold concentration, the cell does not progress to the next stage of the cell cycle. Cyclins therefore control the cell cycle and ensure that cells divide when new cells are needed, but not at other times.

Discovery of cyclins

Serendipity and scientic discoveries: the discovery of cyclins was accidental.

During research into the control of protein synthesis in sea urchin eggs, Tim Hunt discovered a protein that increased in concentration after fertilization then decreased in concentration, unlike other proteins which continued to increase. The protein was being synthesized over a period of about 30 minutes and then soon after was being broken down. Further experiments showed that the protein went through repeated increases and decreases in concentration that coincided with the phases of the cell cycle. The breakdown occurred about ten minutes after the start of mitosis. Hunt named the protein cyclin.

Further research revealed other cyclins and conrmed what Hunt had suspected from an early stage – that cyclins are a key factor in the control of the cell cycle. Tim Hunt was awarded a Nobel Prize for Physiology in 2001 to honour his work in the discovery of cyclins. His Nobel Lecture can be downloaded from the internet and viewed. In it he mentions the importance of serendipity several times because he had not set out to discover how the cell cycle is controlled. This discovery is an example of serendipity – a happy and unexpected discovery made by accident.

Mutagens, oncogenes and metastasis are involved in the development of primary and secondary tumours.
Tumours are abnormal groups of cells that develop at any stage of life in any part of the body. In some cases the cells adhere to each other and do not invade nearby tissues or move to other parts of the body. These tumours are unlikely to cause much harm and are classied as benign. In other tumours the cells can become detached and move elsewhere in the body and develop into secondary tumours. These tumours are malignant and are very likely to be life-threatening.
Diseases due to malignant tumours are commonly known as cancer and have diverse causes. Chemicals and agents that cause cancer are known as carcinogens, because carcinomas are malignant tumours. There are various types of carcinogens including some viruses. All mutagens are carcinogenic, both chemical mutagens and also high energy radiation such as X-rays and short-wave ultraviolet light. This is because mutagens are agents that cause gene mutations and mutations can cause cancer.
Mutations are random changes to the base sequence of genes. Most genes do not cause cancer if they mutate. The few genes that can become cancer-causing after mutating are known as oncogenes. In a normal cell oncogenes are involved in the control of the cell cycle and cell division. This is why mutations in them can result in uncontrolled cell division and therefore tumour formation.
Several mutations must occur in the same cell for it to become a tumour cell. The chance of this happening is extremely small, but because there are vast numbers of cells in the body, the total chance of tumour formation during a lifetime is signicant. When a tumour cell has been formed it divides repeatedly to form two, then four, then eight cells and so on. This group of cells is called a primary tumour. Metastasis is the movement of cells from a primary tumour to set up secondary tumours in other parts of the body.

Tumours can form in any tissue at any age, but the skin, lung, large intestine (bowel), breast and prostate gland are par ticularly vulnerable. Cancer is a major cause of death in most human populations so there is a pressing need to nd methods of prevention and treatment. This involves basic research into the control of the cell cycle. Great progress has been made but more is needed.
Who should pay for research into cancer?

Smoking and cancer
The correlation between smoking and incidence of cancers.
A correlation in science is a relationship between two variable factors. The relationship between smoking and cancer is an example of a correlation. There are two types of correlation. With a positive correlation, when one factor increases the other one also increases; they also decrease together. With a negative correlation, when one factor increases the other decreases.
There is a positive correlation between cigarette smoking and the death rate due to cancer. This has been shown repeatedly in surveys. table 1 shows the results of one of the largest surveys, and the longest

CELL BIOLOGY

continuous one. The data shows that the more cigarettes smoked per day, the higher the death rate due to cancer. They also show a higher death rate among those who smoked at one time but had stopped.
The results of the survey also show huge increases in the death rate due to cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx and lung. This is expected as smoke from cigarettes comes into contact with each of these parts of the body, but there is also a positive correlation between smoking and cancers of the esophagus, stomach, kidney, bladder, pancreas and cervix. Although the death rate due to other cancers is not signicantly different in smokers and non-smokers, table 1 shows smokers are several timesmore likely to die from all cancers than non-smokers.

It is important in science to distinguish between a correlation and a cause. Finding that there is a positive correlation between smoking and cancer does not prove that smoking causes cancer. However, in this case the causal links are well established. Cigarette smoke contains many different chemical substances. Twenty of these have been shown in experiments to cause tumours in the lungs of laboratory animals or humans. There is evidence that at least forty other chemicals in cigarette smoke are carcinogenic. This leaves little doubt that smoking is a cause of cancer.

Molecular biology explains living processes in terms of the chemical substances involved.
The discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 started a revolution in biology that has transformed our understanding of living organisms. It raised the possibility of explaining biological processes from the structure of molecules and how they interact with each other. The structures are diverse and the interactions are very complex, so although molecular biology is more than 50 years old, it is still a relatively young science.
Many molecules are important in living organisms including one as apparently simple as water, but the most varied and complex molecules are nucleic acids and proteins. Nucleic acids comprise DNA and RNA. They are the chemicals used to make genes. Proteins are astonishingly varied in structure and carry out a huge range of tasks within the cell, including controlling chemical reactions of the cell by acting as enzymes. The relationship between genes and proteins is at the heart of molecular biology.
The approach of the molecular biologist is reductionist as it involves considering the various biochemical processes of a living organism and breaking down into its component parts. This approach has been immensely productive in biology and has given us insights into whole organisms that we would not otherwise have. Some biologists argue that the reductionist approach of the molecular biologist cannot explain everything though, and that when component parts are combined there are emergent properties that cannot be studied without looking at the whole system together.

Urea as an example of a compound that is produced by living organisms but can also be ar ticially synthesized.
Urea is a nitrogen-containing compound with a relatively simple molecular structure (gure 2). It is a component of urine and this was where it was rst discovered. It is produced when there is an excess of amino acids in the body, as a means of excreting the nitrogen from the amino acids. A cycle of reactions, catalysed by enzymes, is used to produce it (gure 3). This happens in the liver. Urea is then transported by the blood stream to the kidneys where it is ltered out and passes out of the body in the urine.
Urea can also be synthesized articially. The chemical reactions used are different from those in the liver and enzymes are not involved, but the urea that is produced is identical.
ammonia + carbon dioxide → ammonium carbamate → urea + water
About 100 million tonnes are produced annually. Most of this is used as a nitrogen fertilizer on crops.

Falsication of theories: the ar ticial synthesis of urea helped to falsify vitalism.

Urea was discovered in urine in the 1720s and was assumed to be a product of the kidneys. At that time it was widely believed that organic compounds in plants and animals could only be made with the help of a “vital principle”. This was part of vitalism – the theory that the origin and phenomena of life are due to a vital principle, which is different from purely chemical or physical forces. Aristotle used the word psyche for the vital principle – a Greek word meaning breath, life or soul.
In 1828 the German chemist Friedrich Wöhler synthesized urea articially using silver isocyanate and ammonium chloride. This was the rst organic compound to be synthesized articially. It was a very signicant step, because no vital principle had been involved in the synthesis. Wöhler wrote this excitedly to the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius:

organic compounds could be as well. Wöhler’s achievement was evidence against the theory of vitalism. It helped to falsify the theory, but it did not cause all biologists to abandon vitalism immediately. It usually requires several pieces of evidence against a theory for most biologists to accept that it has been falsied and sometimes controversies over a theory continue for decades.
Although biologists now accept that processes in living organisms are governed by the same chemical and physical forces as in non-living matter, there remain some organic compounds that have not been synthesized articially. It is still impossible to make complex proteins such as hemoglobin, for example, without using ribosomes and other components of cells. Four years after his synthesis of urea, Wöhler wrote this to Berzelius:

In a manner of speaking, I can no longer hold my chemical water. I must tell you that I can make urea without the kidneys of any animal, be it man or dog.
An obvious deduction was that if urea had been synthesized without a vital principle, other

Carbon atoms can form four bonds allowing a diversity of compounds to exist.
Carbon is only the 15th most abundant element on Earth, but it can be used to make a huge range of different molecules. This has given living organisms almost limitless possibilities for the chemical composition and activities of their cells. The diversity of carbon compounds is explained by the properties of carbon.
Carbon atoms form covalent bonds with other atoms. A covalent bond is formed when two adjacent atoms share a pair of electrons, with one electron contributed by each atom. Covalent bonds are the strongest type of bond between atoms so stable molecules based on carbon can be produced.
Each carbon atom can form up to four covalent bonds – more than most other atoms, so molecules containing carbon can have complex structures. The bonds can be with other carbon atoms to make rings or chains of any length. Fatty acids contain chains of up to 20 carbon atoms for example. The bonds can also be with other elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen or phosphorus.
Carbon atoms can bond with just one other element, such as hydrogen in methane, or they can bond to more than one other element as in ethanol (alcohol found in beer and wine). The four bonds can all be single covalent bonds or there can be two single and one double covalent bond, for example in the carboxyl group of ethanoic acid (the acid in vinegar).

Lipids are a broad class of molecules that are insoluble in water, including steroids, waxes, fatty acids and triglycerides. In common language, triglycerides are fats if they are solid at room temperature or oils if they are liquid at room temperature.

Proteins are composed of one or more chains of amino acids. All of the amino acids in these chains contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, but two of the twenty amino acids also containsulphur.

Nucleic acids are chains of subunits called nucleotides, which contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus. There are two types of nucleic acid: ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA).

Metabolism is the web of all the enzyme catalysed reactions in a cell or organism.
All living organisms carry out large numbers of different chemical reactions. These reactions are catalysed by enzymes. Most of them happen in the cytoplasm of cells but some are extracellular, such as the reactions used to digest food in the small intestine. Metabolism is the sum of all reactions that occur in an organism. Metabolism consists of pathways by which one type of molecule is transformed into another, in a series of small steps. These pathways are mostly chains of reactions but there are also some cycles. An example is shown in gure 3. Even in relatively simple prokaryote cells, metabolism consists of over 1,000 different reactions. Global maps showing all reactions are very complex. They are available on the internet, for example in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.

Anabolism is the synthesis of complex molecules from

simpler molecules including the formation of macromolecules

from monomers by condensation reactions.
Metabolism is often divided into two parts, anabolism and catabolism. Anabolism is reactions that build up larger molecules from smaller ones. An easy way to remember this is by recalling that anabolic steroids are hormones that promote body building. Anabolic reactions require energy, which is usually supplied in the form of ATP. Anabolism includes these processes:

●

Protein synthesis using ribosomes.

●

DNA synthesis during replication.

●

Photosynthesis, including production of glucose from carbon dioxide and water.

●

Synthesis of complex carbohydrates including starch, cellulose and glycogen.

Catabolism is the breakdown of complex molecules

Catabolism is the part of metabolism in which larger molecules are broken down into smaller ones. Catabolic reactions release energy and in some cases this energy is captured in the form of ATP, which can then be used in the cell. Catabolism includes these processes:

●

Digestion of food in the mouth, stomach and small intestine.

●

Cell respiration in which glucose or lipids are oxidized to carbon dioxide and water.

●

Digestion of complex carbon compounds in dead organic matter by decomposers.

Hydgn bnding in wt
Water molecules are polar and hydrogen bonds form between them.
A water molecule is formed by covalent bonds between an oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. The bond between hydrogen and oxygen involves unequal sharing of electrons – it is a polar covalent bond. This is because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to electrons than the nuclei of the hydrogen atoms (gure 1).
Because of the unequal sharing of electrons in water molecules, the hydrogen atoms have a partial positive charge and oxygen has a partial negative charge. Because water molecules are bent rather than linear, the two hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the molecule and form one pole and the oxygen forms the opposite pole.
Positively charged particles (positive ions) and negatively charged particles (negative ions) attract each other and form an ionic bond. Water molecules only have partial charges, so the attraction is less but it is still enough to have signicant effects. The attraction between water molecules is a “hydrogen bond”. Strictly speaking it is an intermolecular force rather than a bond. A hydrogen bond is the force that forms when a hydrogen atom in one polar molecule is attracted to a slightly negative atom of another polar covalent molecule.
Although a hydrogen bond is a weak intermolecular force, water molecules are small, so there are many of them per unit volume of water and large numbers of hydrogen bonds (gure 2). Collectively they give water its unique properties and these properties are, in turn, of immense importance to living things.

Use theories to explain natural phenomena: the theory that hydrogen bonds form

between water molecules explains water ’s proper ties.

There is strong experimental evidence for hydrogen bonds, but it remains a theory that they form between water molecules. Scientists cannot prove without doubt that they exist as they are not directly visible. However, hydrogen bonds are a very useful way of explaining the properties of water. They explain the cohesive, adhesive, thermal and solvent properties of water. It is these distinctive properties that make water so useful to living organisms.

It might seem unwise to base our understanding of the natural world on something that has not been proven to exist. However this is the way that science works – we can assume that a theory is correct if there is evidence for it, if it helps to predict behaviour, if it has not been falsied and ifit helps to explain natural phenomena.

Pptis f wt

Hydrogen bonding and dipolarity explain the cohesive, adhesive, thermal and solvent proper ties of water. Cohesive proper ties
Cohesion refers to the binding together of two molecules of the same type, for instance two water molecules.

Water molecules are cohesive – they cohere, which means they stick to each other, due to hydrogen bonding, described in the previous section. This property is useful for water transport in plants. Water is sucked through xylem vessels at low pressure. The method can only work if the water molecules are not separated by the suction forces. Due to hydrogen bonding this rarely happens and water can be pulled up to the top of the tallest trees – over a hundred metres.
Adhesive proper ties Hydrogen bonds can form between water and other polar molecules, causing water to stick to them. This is called adhesion. This property is useful in leaves, where water adheres to cellulose molecules in cell walls. If water evaporates from the cell walls and is lost from the leaf via the network of air spaces, adhesive forces cause water to be drawn out of the nearest xylem vessel. This keeps the walls moist so they can absorb carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis.
Thermal proper ties Water has several thermal properties that are useful to living organisms:

●

High specic heat capacity. Hydrogen bonds restrict the motion of water molecules and increases in the temperature of water require hydrogen bonds to be broken. Energy is needed to do this. As a result, the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of water is relatively large. To cool down, water must lose relatively large amounts of energy. Water’s temperature remains relatively stable in comparison to air or land, so it is a thermally stable habitat for aquatic organisms.

●

High latent heat of vaporization. When a molecule evaporates it separates from other molecules in a liquid and becomes a vapour molecule. The heat needed to do this is called the latent heat of

How do scientic explanations dier from pseudo-scientic explanations?
Homeopathy is a practice where remedies are prepared by dissolving things like charcoal, spider venom or deadly nightshade. This “mother tincture” of harmful substance is diluted again and again to the point where a sample from the solution is unlikely to contain a single molecule of the solute. It is this ultra-dilute solution that is claimed to have medicinal proper ties. The proper ties are referred to as the “memory of water ”. Despite the large number of practitioners of this practice, no homeopathic remedy has ever been shown to work in a large randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.

vaporization. Evaporation therefore has a cooling effect. Considerable amounts of heat are needed to evaporate water, because hydrogen bonds have to be broken. This makes it a good evaporative coolant. Sweating is an example of the use of water as a coolant.

●

High boiling point. The boiling point of a substance is the highest temperature that it can reach in a liquid state. For the same reasons that water has a high latent heat of vaporization, its boiling point is high. Water is therefore liquid over a broad range of temperatures – from 0 °C to 100 °C. This is the temperature range found in most habitats on Earth.

Solvent proper ties Water has important solvent properties. The polar nature of the water molecule means that it forms shells around charged and polar molecules, preventing them from clumping together and keeping them in solution. Water forms hydrogen bonds with polar molecules. Its partially negative oxygen pole is attracted to positively charged ions and its partially positive hydrogen pole is attracted to negatively charged ions, so both dissolve. Cytoplasm is a complex mixture of dissolved substances in which the chemical reactions of metabolism occurs.

Hydphii nd hydphbi
Substances can be hydrophilic or hydrophobic.
The literal meaning of the word hydrophilic is water-loving. It is used to describe substances that are chemically attracted to water. All substances that dissolve in water are hydrophilic, including polar molecules such as glucose, and particles with positive or negative charges such as sodium and chloride ions. Substances that water adheres to, cellulose for example, are also hydrophilic.
Some substances are insoluble in water although they dissolve in other solvents such as propanone (acetone). The term hydrophobic is used to describe them, though they are not actually water-fearing. Molecules are hydrophobic if they do not have negative or positive charges and are nonpolar. All lipids are hydrophobic, including fats and oils

2 . 2 Wat e r
If a nonpolar molecule is surrounded by water molecules, hydrogen bonds form between the water molecules, but not between the nonpolar molecule and the water molecules. If two nonpolar molecules are surrounded by water molecules and random movements bring them together, they behave as though they are attracted to each other. There is a slight attraction between nonpolar molecules, but more signicantly, if they are in contact with each other, more hydrogen bonds can form between water molecules. This is not because they are water-fearing: it is simply because water molecules are more attracted to each other than to the nonpolar molecules. As a result, nonpolar molecules tend to join together in water to form larger and larger groups. The forces that cause nonpolar molecules to join together into groups in water are known as hydrophobic interactions.

Comparison of the thermal proper ties of water with those of methane.
The properties of water have already been described. Methane is a waste product of anaerobic respiration in certain prokaryotes that live in habitats where oxygen is lacking. Methanogenic prokaryotes live in swamps and other wetlands and in the guts of animals, including termites, cattle and sheep. They also live in waste dumps and are deliberately encouraged to produce methane in anaerobic digesters. Methane can be used as a fuel but if allowed to escape into the atmosphere it contributes to the greenhouse effect.
Water and methane are both small molecules with atoms linked by single covalent bonds. However water molecules are polar and can form hydrogen bonds, whereas methane molecules are nonpolar and do not form hydrogen bonds. As a result their physical properties are very different.
The data in table 1 shows some of the physical properties of methane and water. The density and specic heat capacity are given for methane and water in a liquid state. The data shows that water has a higher specic heat capacity, higher latent heat of vaporization, higher melting point and higher boiling point. Whereas methane is liquid over a range of only 22 °C, water is liquid over 100 °C.

Use of water as a coolant in sweat.

Sweat is secreted by glands in the skin. The sweat is carried along narrow ducts to the surface of the skin where it spreads out. The heat needed for the evaporation of water in sweat is taken from the tissues of the skin, reducing their temperature. Blood owing through the skin is therefore cooled. This is an effective method of cooling the body because water has a high latent heat of vaporization. Solutes in the sweat, especially ions such as sodium, are left on the skin surface and can sometimes be detected by their salty taste.

There are methods of cooling other than sweating, though many of these also rely on heat loss due to evaporation of water. Panting in dogs and birds is an example. Transpiration is evaporative loss of water from plant leaves; it has a cooling effect which is useful in hot environments.

Sweat secretion is controlled by the hypothalamus of the brain. It has receptors that monitor blood temperature and also receives sensory inputs from temperature receptors in the skin. If the body is overheated the hypothalamus stimulates the sweat glands to secrete up to two litres of sweat per hour. Usually no sweat is secreted if the body is below the target temperature, though when adrenalin is secreted we sweat even if we are already cold. This is because adrenalin is secreted when our brain anticipates a period of intense activity that will tend to cause the body to overheat.

Methods of transpor t of glucose, amino acids, cholesterol, fats, oxygen and

sodium chloride in blood in relation to their solubility in water.

Blood transports a wide variety of substances, using several methods to avoid possible problems and ensure that each substance is carried in large enough quantities for the body’s needs.

Sodium chloride is an ionic compound that is

freely soluble in water, dissolving to form sodium

+ ions (Na ) and chloride ions (Cl

), which are

carried in blood plasma.

Amino acids have both negative and positive charges. Because of this they are soluble in water but their solubility varies depending on the R group, some of which are hydrophilic while others are hydrophobic. All amino acids are soluble enough to be carried dissolved in blood plasma.

Glucose is a polar molecule. It is freely soluble in water and is carried dissolved in blood plasma.
Oxygen is a nonpolar molecule. Because of the small size of the molecule it dissolves in water but only sparingly and water becomes saturated with oxygen at relatively low concentrations. Also, as the temperature of water rises, the solubility of oxygen decreases, so blood plasma at 37 °C can hold much less dissolved oxygen than water at 20 °C or lower. The amount of oxygen that blood plasma can transport around the body is far too little to provide for aerobic cell respiration. This problem is overcome by the use of hemoglobin in red blood cells. Hemoglobin has binding sites for oxygen and greatly increases the capacity of the blood for oxygen transport.

Fats molecules are entirely nonpolar, are larger than oxygen and are insoluble in water. They are carried in blood inside lipoprotein complexes. These are groups of molecules with a single layer of phospholipid on the outside and fats inside. The hydrophilic phosphate heads of the phospholipids face outwards and are in contact with water in the blood plasma. The hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails face inwards and are in contact with the fats. There are also proteins in the phospholipid monolayer, hence the name lipoprotein.

phospholipid protein cholesterol
triglyceride

Cholesterol molecules are hydrophobic, apart from a small hydrophilic region at one end. This is not enough to make cholesterol dissolve in water and instead it is transported with fats in lipoprotein complexes. The cholesterol molecules are positioned in the phospholipid monolayers, with the hydrophilic region facing outwards in the region with the phosphate heads of the phospholipids.

Thomas Kuhn, in his book The Structure of Scientic Revolutions adopted the word ‘paradigm’ to refer to the frameworks that dominate the interpretation of information in a scientic discipline at a particular point in time. The paradigm impacts the kinds of questions that are supposed to be asked.
Nutritionism is the reductionist paradigm that the presence of indicator nutrients are the key determinant of healthy food. Even highly processed food may be advertised as healthy depending on the degree to which it contains ‘healthy’ nutrients. Words like ‘carbs’, ‘vitamins’ and ‘polyunsaturated fat’ have entered the everyday lexicon. Some argue that this aligns consumer anxiety with the commercial interests of food manufacturers.
An alternative paradigm for determining the ‘healthiness’ of food is argued for by Michael Pollan in his book “In Defense of Food”. It argues that food quality should be determined by cultural tradition which tended to look at food more holistically:
The sheer novelty and glamor of the Western diet, with its seventeen thousand new food products every year and the marketing power – thirty-two billion dollars a year – used to sell us those products, has overwhelmed the force of tradition and left us where we now nd ourselves: relying on science and journalism and government and marketing to help us decide what to eat

Monosaccharide monomers are linked together by condensation reactions to form disaccharides and polysaccharide polymers.
Glucose, fructose and ribose are all examples of monosaccharides. The structure of glucose and ribose molecules was shown in sub-topic 2.1. Monosaccharides can be linked together to make larger molecules.

●

Monosaccharides are single sugar units.

●

Disaccharides consist of two monosaccharides linked together. For example, maltose is made by linking two glucose molecules together. Sucrose is made by linking a glucose and a fructose.

●

Polysaccharides consist of many monosaccharides linked together. Starch, glycogen and cellulose are polysaccharides. They are all made by linking together glucose molecules. The differences between them are described later in this sub-topic.

When monosaccharides combine, they do so by a process called

condensation (gure 1). This involves the loss of an

OH from one

molecule and an

H from another molecule, which together form

H O. Thus, condensation involves the combination of subunits and 2
yields water.

Linking together monosaccharides to form disaccharides and polysaccharides is an anabolic process and energy has to be used to do it. ATP supplies energy to the monosaccharides and this energy is then used when the condensation reaction occurs.

Structure and function of cellulose and starch in plants and glycogen in humans.
Starch, glycogen and cellulose are all made by linking together glucose molecules, yet their structure and functions are very different. This is due to differences in the type of glucose used to make them and in the type of linkage between glucose molecules.

Glucose has ve

OH groups, any of which

could be used in condensation reactions, but

only three of them are actually used to link to

make polysaccharides. The most common link is

between the

OH on carbon atom 1 (on the right

hand side in molecular diagrams of glucose) and

the

OH on carbon atom 4 (shown on the left

hand side). The

OH on carbon atom 6 (shown

at the top of molecular diagrams) is used to form

side branches in some polysaccharides.

▲ Figure 3 Glucose molecule

Glucose can have the

OH group on carbon atom 1

pointing either upwards or downwards. In alpha

glucose (α-glucose) the

OH group points downwards

but in beta glucose (β-glucose) it points upwards.

This small difference has major consequences for

polysaccharides made from glucose.

Cellulose is made by linking together β-glucose

molecules. Condensation reactions link carbon atom

1 to carbon atom 4 on the next β-glucose. The

OH

groups on carbon atom 1 and 4 point in opposite

directions: up on carbon 1 and down on carbon4.

To bring these

OH groups together and allow a

condensation reaction to occur, each β-glucose

added to the chain has to be positioned at 180° to

the previous one. The glucose subunits in the chain

are oriented alternately upwards and downwards.

The consequence of this is that the cellulose

molecule is a straight chain, rather than curved.

▲ Figure 4 Cellulose
Cellulose molecules are unbranched chains of β-glucose, allowing them to form bundles with hydrogen bonds linking the cellulose molecules. These bundles are called cellulose microbrils. They have very high tensile strength and are used as the basis of plant cell walls. The tensile strength of cellulose prevents plant cells from bursting, even when very high pressures have developed inside the cell due to entry of water by osmosis.

Starch is made by linking together α-glucose

molecules. As in cellulose, the links are made by

condensation reactions between the

OH groups on

carbon atom 1 of one glucose and carbon atom4

of the adjacent glucose. These

OH groups both

point downwards, so all the glucose molecules

in starch can be orientated in the same way. The

consequence of this is that the starch molecule is

curved, rather than straight. There are two forms of

starch. In amylose the chain of α-glucose molecules

is unbranched and forms a helix. In amylopectin the

chain is branched, so has a more globular shape.

Starch is only made by plant cells. Molecules of both types of starch are hydrophilic but they are too large to be soluble in water. They are therefore useful in cells where large amounts of glucose need to be stored, but a concentrated glucose solution would cause too much water to enter a cell by osmosis. Starch is used as a store of glucose and therefore of energy in seeds and storage organs such as potato cells. Starch is made as a temporary store in leaf cells when glucose is being made faster by photosynthesis than it can be exported to other parts of the plant.

▲ Figure 5 Starch
glycogen it is easy to add extra glucose molecules or remove them. This can be done at both ends of an unbranched molecule or at any of the ends in a branched molecule. Starch and glycogen molecules do not have a xed size and the number of glucose molecules that they contain can be increased or decreased.

Glycogen is very similar to the branched form of starch, but there is more branching, making the molecule more compact. Glycogen is made by animals and also some fungi. It is stored in the liver and some muscles in humans. Glycogen has the same function as starch in plants: it acts as a store of energy in the form of glucose, in cells where large stores of dissolved glucose would cause osmotic problems. With both starch and

lipids Triglycerides are formed by condensation from three fatty acids and one glycerol.
Lipids are a diverse group of carbon compounds that share the property of being insoluble in water. Triglycerides are one of the principal groups of lipid. Examples of triglycerides are the fat in adipose tissue in humans

and the oil in sunower seeds. Fats are liquid at body temperature (37°C) but solid at room temperature (20 °C) whereas oils are liquid at both body temperature and room temperature.

A triglyceride is made by combining three fatty acids with one glycerol

(see gure 7). Each of the fatty acids is linked to the glycerol by a

condensation reaction, so three water molecules are produced. The

linkage formed between each fatty acid and the glycerol is an ester bond.

This type of bond is formed when an acid reacts with the

OH group in

an alcohol. In this case the reaction is between the

COOH group on a

fatty acid and an

OH on the glycerol.

Triglycerides are used as energy stores. The energy from them can be released by aerobic cell respiration. Because they do not conduct heat well, they are used as heat insulators, for example in the blubber of Arctic marine mammals.

Lipids are more suitable for long term energy storage in humans than carbohydrates.

Lipids and carbohydrates are both used for energy storage in humans, but lipids are normally used for long-term energy storage. The lipids that are used are fats. They are stored in specialized groups of cells called adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is located immediately beneath the skin and also around some organs including the kidneys.

There are several reasons for using lipids rather than carbohydrates for long-term energy storage:

●

The amount of energy released in cell respiration per gram of lipids is double the amount released from a gram of carbohydrates. The same amount of energy stored as lipid rather than carbohydrate therefore adds half as much to body mass. In fact the mass advantage of lipids is even

greater because fats form pure droplets in cells with no water associated, whereas each gram of glycogen is associated with about two grams of water, so lipids are actually six times more efcient in the amount of energy that can be stored per gram of body mass. This is important, because we have to carry our energy stores around with us wherever we go. It is even more important for animals such as birds and bats that y.

●

Stored lipids have s o me se cond ar y r ol e s that could not be performed as well by carbohydrates. Because lipids are poor conductors of heat, they can be used as heat insulators. This is the reason for much of our stored fat being in sub-cutaneous adipose tissue next to the skin. Because fat

78

is liquid at body temperature, it can also act as a shock absorb e r. T hi s is the re a son for adipose tissue around the kidneys and some other organs.
Glycogen is the carbohydrate that is used for energy storage, in the liver and in some muscles. Although lipids are ideal for longterm storage of ene r g y, g ly co ge n is u s ed for short-term storage. This is because glycogen

can be broken down to glucose rapidly and then transported easily by the blood to where it is needed. Fats in adipose tissue cannot be mobilized as rapidl y. Glucos e ca n b e u se d e it h e r in anaerobic or aerobic cell respiration whereas fats and fatty acids can only be used in aerobic respiration. The liver stores up to 150 grams of glycogen and some muscles store up to 2% glycogen by mass.

Determination of body mass index by calculation or use of a nomogram.
The body mass index, usually abbreviated to BMI, was developed by aBelgian statistician, Adolphe Quetelet. Two measurements are needed to calculate it: the mass of the person in kilograms and their height in metres. BMI is calculated using this formula:

BMI =

mass in kilograms __
2 (height in metres)

2 Units for BMI are kg m

BMI can also be found using a type of chart called a nomogram. A straight line between the height on the left hand scale and the mass on the right hand scale intersects the BMI on the central scale. The data based questions on page 81 include a BMI nomogram.
BMI is used to assess whether a person’s body mass is at a healthy level, or is too high or too low. Table 1 shows how this is done:

In some parts of the world food supplies are insufcient or are unevenly distributed and many people as a result are underweight. In other parts of the world a likelier cause of being underweight is anorexia nervosa. This is a psychological condition that involves voluntary starvation and loss of body mass.

Obesity is an increasing problem in some countries. Excessive food intake and insufcient exercise cause an accumulation of fat in adipose tissue. The amount of body fat can be estimated using skinfold calipers (gure 9). Obesity increases the risk of conditions such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. It reduces life expectancy signicantly and is increasing the overall costs of health care in countries where rates of obesity are rising.

Fatty acids can be saturated, monounsaturated or

polyunsaturated.

The basic structure of fatty acids was described in sub-topic 2.1. There is

a chain of carbon atoms, with hydrogen atoms linked to them by single

covalent bonds. It is therefore a hydrocarbon chain. At one end of the

chain is the acid part of the molecule. This is a carboxyl group, which

can be represented as

COOH.

The length of the hydrocarbon chain is variable but most of the fatty acids used by living organisms have between 14 and 20 carbon atoms. Another variable feature is the bonding between the carbon atoms. In some fatty

acids all of the carbon atoms are linked by single covalent bonds, but in other fatty acids there are one or more positions in the chain where carbon atoms are linked by double covalent bonds.
If a carbon atom is linked to adjacent carbons in the chain by single bonds, it can also bond to two hydrogen atoms. If a carbon atom is linked by a double bond to an adjacent carbon in the chain, it can only bond to one hydrogen atom. A fatty acid with single bonds between all of its carbon atoms therefore contains as much hydrogen as it possibly could and is called a saturated fatty acid. Fatty acids that have one or more double bonds are unsaturated because they contain less hydrogen than they could. If there is one double bond, the fatty acid is monounsaturated and if it has more than one double bond it is polyunsaturated
Figure 12 shows one saturated fatty acid, one monounsaturated and one polyunsaturated fatty acid. It is not necessary to remember names of specic fatty acids in IB Biology.

▲ Figure 12 Examples of fatty acids

In unsaturated fatty acids in living organisms, the hydrogen atoms are nearly always on the same side of the two carbon atoms that are double bonded – these are called cis-fatty acids. The alternative is for the hydrogens to be on opposite sides – called trans-fatty acids. These two conformations are shown in gure 14.
In cis-fatty acids, there is a bend in the hydrocarbon chain at the double bond. This makes triglycerides containing cis-unsaturated fatty acids less good at packing together in regular arrays than saturated fatty acids, so it lowers the melting point. Triglycerides with cis-unsaturated fatty acids are therefore usually liquid at room temperature – they are oils.

Trans-fatty acids do not have a bend in the hydrocarbon chain at the double bond, so they have a higher melting point and are solid at room temperature. Trans-fatty acids are produced articially by partial hydrogenation of vegetable or sh oils. This is done to produce solid fats for use in margarine and some other processedfoods.

Scientic evidence for health risks of trans-fats and saturated fats.
There have been many claims about the effects of different types of fat on human health. The main concern is coronary heart disease (CHD). In this disease the coronary arteries become partially blocked by fatty deposits, leading to blood clot formation and heart attacks.
A positive correlation has been found between saturated fatty acid intake and rates of CHD in many research programs. However, nding a correlation does not prove that saturated fats cause the disease. It could be another factor correlated with saturated fat intake, such as low amounts of dietary bre, that actually causes CHD.
There are populations that do not t the correlation. The Maasai of Kenya for example have a diet that is rich in meat, fat, blood and milk. They therefore have a high consumption of saturated fats, yet CHD is almost unknown among the Maasai. Figure 17 shows members of another Kenyan tribe that show this trend.
Diets rich in olive oil, which contains cis-monounsaturated fatty acids, are traditionally eaten in countries around the Mediterranean. The populations of these countries typically have low rates of CHD and it has been claimed that this is due to the intake of cis-monounsaturated fatty acids. However, genetic factors in these populations, or other aspects of the diet such as the use of tomatoes in many dishes could explain the CHD rates.
There is also a positive correlation between amounts of trans-fat consumed and rates of CHD. Other risk factors have been tested, to see if they can account for the correlation, but none did. Trans-fats therefore probably do cause CHD. In patients who had died from CHD, fatty deposits in the diseased arteries have been found to contain high concentrations of trans-fats, which gives more evidence of a causal link.

Evaluating claims: health claims made about lipids need to be assessed.

Many health claims about foods are made. In some cases the claim is that the food has a health benet and in other cases it is that the food is harmful. Many claims have been found to be false when they are tested scientically.
It is relatively easy to test claims about the effects of diet on health using laboratory animals. Large numbers of genetically uniform animals can be bred and groups of them with the same age, sex and state of health can be selected for use in experiments. Variables other than diet, such as temperature and amount of exercise, can be controlled so that they do not inuence the results of the experiment. Diets can be designed so that only one dietary factor varies and strong evidence can thus be obtained about the effect of this factor on the animal.
Results of animal experiments are often interesting, but they do not tell us with certainty what the health effects are on humans of a factor in the diet. It would be very difcult to carry out

similar controlled experiments with humans. It might be possible to select matched groups of experimental subjects in terms of age, sex and health, but unless identical twins were used they would be genetically different. It would also be almost impossible to control other variables such as exercise and few humans would be willing to eat a very strictly controlled diet for a long enough period.
Researchers into the health risks of food must therefore use a different approach. Evidence is obtained by epidemiological studies. These involve nding a large cohort of people, measuring their food intake and following their health over a period of years. Statistical procedures can then be used to nd out whether factors in the diet are associated with an increased frequency of a particular disease. The analysis has to eliminate the effects of other factors that could be causing the disease.

Nature of science question: using volunteers in experiments.

During the Second World War, experiments were conducted both in England and in the US using conscientious objectors to military service as volunteers. The volunteers were willing to sacrice their health to help extend medical knowledge. A vitamin C trial in England involved 20 volunteers. For six weeks they were all given a diet containing 70 mg of vitamin C. Then, for the next eight months, three volunteers were kept on the diet with 70 mg, seven had their dose reduced to 10 mg and ten were given no vitamin C. All of these ten volunteers developed scurvy. Three-centimetre cuts were made in their thighs, with the wounds closed up with ve stitches. These wounds failed to heal. There was also bleeding from hair follicles and from the gums. Some of the volunteers developed more serious heart problems. The groups given 10 mg or 70mg of vitamin C fared equally well and did notdevelopscurvy.
Experiments on requirements for vitamin C have also been done using real guinea-pigs, which ironically are suitable because guinea-pigs, like

humans, cannot synthesize ascorbic acid. During trial periods with various intakes of vitamin C, concentrations in blood plasma and urine were monitored. The guinea-pigs were then killed and collagen in bone and skin was tested. The collagen in guinea-pigs with restricted vitamin C had less cross-linking between the protein bres and therefore lower strength.

Evaluation of evidence and the methods used to obtain the evidence for health

claims made about lipids.
An evaluation is dened in IB as an assessment of implications and limitations. Evidence for health claims comes from scientic research. There are two questions to ask about this research:

1

Implications – do the results of the research

support the health claim strongly, moderately

or not at all?

●

How widely spread is the data? This is shown by the spread of data points on a scattergraph or the size of error bars on a bar chart. The more widely spread the data, the less likely it is that mean differences are signicant.

●

If statistical tests have been done on the data, do they show signicant differences?

2

Limitations – were the research methods used

rigorous, or are there uncertainties about

the conclusions because of weaknesses in

methodology?

The second question is answered by assessing the methods used. The points below refer to surveys and slightly different questions should be asked to assess controlled experiments.

The rst question is answered by analysing the results of the research – either experimental results or results of a survey. Analysis is usually easiest if the results are presented as a graph or other type of visual display.

●

Is there a correlation between intake of the lipid being investigated and rate of the disease or the health benet? This might be either a positive or negative correlation.

●

How large is the difference between mean (average) rates of the disease with different levels of lipid intake? Small differences may not be signicant.

●

How large was the sample size? In surveys it is usually necessary to have thousands of people in a survey to get reliable results.

●

How even was the sample in sex, age, state of health and life style? The more even the sample, the less other factors can affect theresults.

●

If the sample was uneven, were the results adjusted to eliminate the effects of other factors?

●

Were the measurements of lipid intake and disease rates reliable? Sometimes people in a survey do not report their intake accurately and diseases are sometimes misdiagnosed.

It began in 1976 with 121,700 female nurses in the USA and Canada, who completed a lengthy questionnaire about their lifestyle factors and medical history. Follow-up questionnaires have been completed every two years since then.
Details of the methods used to assess diet and diagnose coronary heart disease can be found by reading a research paper in the American Journal of Epidemiology, which is freely available on the internet: Oh, K, Hu, FB, Manson, JE, Stampfer, MJ and Willett, WC.

Amino acids are linked together by condensation to form polypeptides.
Polypeptides are chains of amino acids that are made by linking together amino acids by condensation reactions. This happens on ribosomes by a process called translation, which will be described in sub-topic 2.7. Polypeptides are the main component of proteins and in many proteins they are the only component. Some proteins contain one polypeptide and other proteins contain two or more.

The condensation reaction involves the amine group (

acid and the carboxyl group (

COOH) of another. Water is eliminated, as

in all condensation reactions, and a new bond is formed between the two amino acids, called a peptide bond. A dipeptide is a molecule consisting of two amino acids linked by a peptide bond. A polypeptide is a molecule consisting of many amino acids linked by peptide bonds.
Polypeptides can contain any number of amino acids, though chains of fewer than 20 amino acids are usually referred to as oligopeptides rather than polypeptides. Insulin is a small protein that contains two polypeptides, one with 21 amino acids and the other with 30. The largest polypeptide discovered so far is titin, which is part of the structure of muscle. In humans titin is a chain of 34,350 amino acids, but in mice it is even longer with 35,213 amino acids.

Draw molecular diagrams to show the formation of a peptide bond.

To form a dipeptide, two amino acids are linked by a condensation reaction between the amine group of one amino acid and the carboxyl group of the other. This is shown in gure 1.
The peptide bond is the same, whatever R group the amino acid carries. To test your skill at showing how peptide bonds are formed, try showing the formation of a peptide bond between two of the amino acids in gure 2. There are sixteen possible dipeptides that can be produced from these four amino acids.
You could also try to draw an oligopeptide of four amino acids, linked by three peptide bonds. If you do this correctly, you should see these features:

There are twenty dierent amino acids in polypeptides synthesized on ribosomes.
The amino acids that are linked together by ribosomes to make polypeptides all have some identical structural features: a carbon atom in the centre of the molecule is bonded to an amine group, a carboxyl group and a hydrogen atom. The carbon atom is also bonded to an R group, which is different in each amino acid.

2 . 4 P r ot e in s

Twenty different amino acids are used by ribosomes to make polypeptides. The amine groups and the carboxyl groups are used up in forming the peptide bond, so it is the R groups of the amino acids that give a polypeptide its character. The repertoire of R groups allows living organisms to make and use an amazingly wide range of proteins. Some of the differences are shown in table 1. It is not necessary to try to learn these specic differences but it is important to remember that because of the differences between their R groups, the twenty amino acids are chemically very diverse.
Some proteins contain amino acids that are not in the basic repertoire of twenty. In most cases this is due to one of the twenty being modied after a polypeptide has been synthesized. There is an example of modication of amino acids in collagen, a structural protein used to provide tensile strength in tendons, ligaments, skin and blood vessel walls. Collagen polypeptides made by ribosomes contain proline at many positions, but at some of these positions it is converted to hydroxyproline, which makes the collagen more stable.

Patterns, trends and discrepancies: most but not all organisms assemble

polypeptides from the same amino acids.

It is a remarkable fact that most organisms make proteins using the same 20 amino acids. In some cases amino acids are modied after a polypeptide has been synthesized, but the initial process of linking together amino acids on ribosomes with peptide bonds usually involves the same 20 amino acids.

We can exclude the possibility that this trend is due to chance. There must be one or more reasons for it. Several hypotheses have been proposed:

●

These 20 amino acids were the ones produced by chemical processes on Earth before the origin of life, so all organisms used them and have continued to use them. Other amino acids might have been used, if they had been available.

●

They are the ideal 20 amino acids for making a wide range of proteins, so natural selection

will always favour organisms that use them and do not use other amino acids.

●

All life has evolved from a single ancestral species, which used these 20 amino acids. Because of the way that polypeptides are made by ribosomes, it is difcult for any organism to change the repertoire of amino acids, either by removing existing ones or adding new ones.

Biology is a complicated science and discrepancies are commonly encountered. Some species have been found that use one of the three codons that normally signal the end of polypeptide synthesis (stop codons) to encode an extra non-standard amino acid. For example, some species use UGA to code for selenocysteine and some use UAG to code for pyrrolysine.

Cell walls of bacteria contain peptidoglycan, a complex carbon

compound that contains sugars and short chains of amino acids.

Some of these amino acids are different from the usual repertoire

of 20. Also, some of them are right-handed forms of amino acids,

whereas the 20 amino acids made into polypeptides are always the

left-handed forms. Discuss whether this is a signicant discrepancy

that falsies the theory that living organisms all make polypeptides

Amino acids can be linked together in any sequence giving a huge range of possible polypeptides.
Ribosomes link amino acids together one at a time, until a polypeptide is fully formed. The ribosome can make peptide bonds between any pair of amino acids, so any sequence of amino acids is possible.

The number of possible amino acid sequences can be calculated starting

with dipeptides (table 2). Both amino acids in a dipeptide can be any

of the twenty so there are twenty times twenty possible sequences

n

apolypeptide of n amino acids there are 20

possible sequences.

The number of amino acids in a polypeptide can be anything from 20 to

tens of thousands. Taking one example, if a polypeptide has 400 amino

400

acids, there are 20

possible amino acid sequences. This is a mind-

bogglingly large number and some online calculators simply express it as

innity. If we add all the possible sequences for other numbers of amino

acids, the number is effectively innite.

The amino acid sequence of polypeptides is coded for by genes.
The number of amino acid sequences that could be produced is immense, but living organisms only actually produce a small fraction of these. Even so, a typical cell produces polypeptides with thousands of different sequences and must store the information needed to do this. The amino acid sequence of each polypeptide is stored in a coded form in the base sequence of a gene.
Some genes have other roles, but most genes in a cell store the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. They use the genetic code to do this. Three bases of the gene are needed to code for each amino acid in the polypeptide. In theory a polypeptide with 400 amino acids should require a gene with a sequence of 1,200 bases. In practice genes are

2 . 4 P r ot e in s

always longer, with extra base sequences at both ends and sometimes also at certain points in the middle.
The base sequence that actually codes for a polypeptide is known to molecular biologists as the open reading frame. One puzzle is that openreading frames only occupy a small proportion of the total DNA ofa species.

Some proteins are single polypeptides, but others are composed of two or more polypeptides linked together.
Integrin is a membrane protein with two polypeptides, each of which has a hydrophobic portion embedded in the membrane. Rather like the blade and handle of a folding knife the two polypeptides can either be adjacent to each other or can unfold and move apart when it is working.

Collagen consists of three long polypeptides wound together to form a rope-like molecule. This structure has greater tensile strength than the three polypeptides would if they were separate. The winding allows a small amount of stretching, reducing the chance of the molecule breaking.
Hemoglobin consists of four polypeptides with associated non-polypeptide structures. The four parts of hemoglobin interact to transport oxygen more effectively to tissues that need it than if they were separate.

▲ Figure 6 Lysozyme, showing how a polypeptide can be folded up to form a globular protein. Three sections that are wound to form a helix are shown red and a section that forms a sheet is shown yellow. Other parts of the polypeptide including both of its ends are green

are elongated, usually with a repeating structure. Many proteins are globular, with an intricate shape that often includes parts that are helical or sheet-like.
Amino acids are added one by one, to form a polypeptide. They are always added in the same sequence to make a particular polypeptide. In globular proteins the polypeptides gradually fold up as they are made, to develop the nal conformation. This is stabilized by bonds between the R groups of the amino acids that have been brought together by thefolding.
In globular proteins that are soluble in water, there are hydrophilic Rgroups on the outside of the molecule and there are usually hydrophobic groups on the inside. In globular membrane proteins there are regions with hydrophobic R groups on the outside of the molecule, which are attracted to the hydrophobic centre of the membrane.
In brous proteins the amino acid sequence prevents folding up and ensures that the chain of amino acids remains in an elongated form.

Denaturation of proteins by heat or pH extremes.

The three-dimensional conformation of proteins is stabilized by bonds or interactions between R groups of amino acids within the molecule. Most of these bonds and interactions are relatively weak and they can be disrupted or broken. This results in a change to the conformation of the protein, which is called denaturation.
A denatured protein does not normally return to its former structure– the denaturation is permanent. Soluble proteins often become insoluble and form a precipitate. This is due to the hydrophobic R groups in the centre of the molecule becoming exposed to the water around by the change in conformation.

Extremes of pH, both acidic and alkaline, can cause denaturation. This is because charges on R groups are changed, breaking ionic bonds within the protein or causing new ionic bonds to form. As with heat, the three-dimensional structure of the protein is altered and proteins that have been dissolved in water often become insoluble. There are exceptions: the contents of the stomach are normally acidic, with a pH as low as 1.5, but this is the optimum pH for the protein-digesting enzyme pepsin that works in the stomach.

Heat can cause denaturation because it causes vibrations within the molecule that can break intermolecular bonds or interactions. Proteins vary in their heat tolerance. Some microorganisms that live in volcanic springs or in hot water near geothermal vents have proteins that are not denatured by temperatures of 80 °C or higher. The best known example is DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus, a prokaryote that was discovered in hot springs in Yellowstone National Park. It works best at 80 °C and because of this it is widely used in biotechnology. Nevertheless, heat causes denaturation of most proteins at much lower temperatures.
