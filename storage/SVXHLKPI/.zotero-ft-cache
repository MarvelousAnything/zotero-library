Johnson 'fears' Putin will use chemical weapons in Ukraine

Boris Johnson said he predicts  Russia  is preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine .

The British PM made the statement against Vladimir Putin ’s “cynical and barbaric” government in an interview with Sky News.

He said: “The stuff that you’re hearing about chemical weapons is straight out of [the Russian] playbook.

“They start saying that there are chemical weapons stored by their opponents, or by Americans. So when they, themselves, deploy chemical weapons – as I fear they may – they have a fake story ready to go.

“And you’ve seen it in Syria, you saw it even in the UK ... I just note that that is what they’re already doing.”

Two million people have fled Kyiv – around half the capital city’s total population, according to its mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

Russian troops have failed to capture the city since Putin launched the invasion on 24 February.

Despite the mass exodus, Mr Klitschko insisted that Kyiv was still safe – saying: “[It] has been transformed into a fortress. Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified.”

‘More than 150 journalists leave Russia over new law’ - report

At least 150 journalists have reportedly fled Russia due to the country’s new law threatening up to 15 years in prison for publishing “fake” information about the invasion of Ukraine.

This is according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which interviewed Taisia Bekbulatova, a Georgia-based chief editor of Russian news site Holod, who had to relocate her team after Russia’s chilling legislation was passed.

She told the Committee: “While we’ve left the country, we do not want to, and will not, stop working. We want to make sure that people can still read about what is actually taking place.

“Working from outside Russia is the only thing that makes sense.”

Facebook has also removed posts by the Russian embassy in London that claimed that the bombardment of a children’s and maternity hospital was faked.

It comes after Twitter removed the posts, saying that they represented “the denial of violent events”.

Hostel on fire after nuclear reactor building ‘shelled by Russia’

Russian forces shelled an institute in the city of Kharkiv that houses an experimental nuclear reactor, Ukraine said.

The bombing has set a nearby hostel on fire, the Ukrainian parliament tweeted with a clip of the blaze.

The fighting in the area close to the Institute of Physics and Technology has continued, it added.

The building was also attacked by Russian forces last week, according to a report by Ukraine’s state nuclear inspectorate.

Unwanted Russian oil and gas poses ‘environmental conundrum’

Unwanted Russian oil and gas pose an “environmental conundrum” as it could lead to extra methane leaks into the environment, energy experts have said.

While the potent greenhouse gas is emitted throughout the stages of fossil fuel production, they said there was an additional risk in oil and gas tankers stranded at sea due to sanctions over the Ukraine war.

If Russia is forced to curtail its fossil fuel production, energy experts said this could also be a problem, which closed wells a “major source” of methane leaks.

‘Major gaps’ in Ukraine visa scheme despite Home Office U-turn

Priti Patel’s changes to Britain’s scheme for Ukrainian refugees do not go “anywhere near far enough” to give proper support to those fleeing conflict, the government has been warned.

In a move to simplify the system, the home secretary announced that, from Tuesday, those who have fled the Russian invasion and have passports will no longer need to go to a visa application centre to submit their fingerprints and documents before they come to the UK.

But experts have said there are “still major gaps” in the government’s support for Ukrainian refugees, warning that people would still be required to go through a “chaotic and frustrating” online application process and calling for “urgent clarity” on who will benefit in practice.

Twitter removes Russia’s denial of Mariupol hospital bombing

Earlier, we reported that Twitter removed tweets posted by Russia’s embassy in London.

A Twitter spokesperson said the tweets were removed as they represented “the denial of violent events”.

The embassy has denied Russia was responsible for destroying a children's and maternity hospital in Mariupol by suggesting that the injured people were actors.

A photo had been posted on Twitter of a heavily-pregnant woman with blood smeared on her face being evacuated from the hospital, where three people – including a child – were killed on Wednesday.

In response to the photo, the embassy wrote: “She is indeed [pregnant]. As she has some very realistic make-up. She is also doing well with her beauty blogs.

“Plus she could not be in the maternity house at the time of the strike, as it has long been taken by the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion who told all the staff to clear the place.”

Twitter’s spokesperson said: “We took enforcement action against the Tweets you referenced as they were in violation of the Twitter Rules, specifically our Hateful Conduct and Abusive Behavior policies related to the denial of violent events.”
