Enraged Russian President Vladimir Putin has gone on a tear, firing as many as eight generals over Moscow’s military losses in the invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv’s defense chief claims.

Ukraine Defense Secretary Oleksiy Danilov made the claim on Ukrainian TV Wednesday, according to the newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda .

“[The enemy] had about 8 generals removed from their posts because they did not complete the task. New ones have been appointed,” Danilov said. 

“We clearly understand what is happening in the Russian Federation,” he added. “What’s more, I can tell they’re desperate.”

The claims by Danilov come amid other indications that all is not well in Moscow.

A March 1 report from independent Russian journalist Farida Rustamova claimed that Kremlin insiders were privately declaring the invasion “a clusterf–k.”

The report quoted one high-level source as casting doubt on Putin’s state of mind.

“He is in a state of being offended and insulted,” said the source, described as a “good acquaintance” of the Russian leader. “It’s paranoia that has reached the point of absurdity.”

Russian Maj. Gen. Vitaly Gerasimov, a veteran of Russian campaigns in Syria as well as the 2014 annexation of Crimea, was killed in the fighting outside Kharkiv, Ukrainian intelligence said Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division and a veteran of the Syrian campaign, was reportedly cut down by Ukrainian snipers last week.
