Introduction
Estimates of dry-weight biomass for individual trees and tree components are of interest to managers, researchers, and policymakers. Such estimates can be used by land managers to estimate carbon (C) pools and fluxes on individual parcels, by policymakers to estimate forest C dynamics at large scales, or by scientists to enhance our understanding of C dynamics in conjunction with research studies.

We made a concerted effort to locate the original sources of all regression equations. However, some reviews reported “unpublished” results and it was not always possible to find the full text of the original sources, particularly for those published other than in peerreviewed journals. In these cases, we report the equations here but we describe them as “cited in” the published review. In contrast to our previous work developing the generalized equations, here we make no attempt to exclude equations that do not meet prespecified criteria. Instead, we report all equations found in the literature.

To guide the reader in using these equations, we provide information on component definitions, author-reported regression statistics such as R2 values, diameter ranges over which the equations were developed, number of trees harvested to develop the regression, locations of harvested trees, and other pertinent notes and variables. We have attempted to be as comprehensive as possible; however, we cannot anticipate every question that might be asked by a user, and the authors of the original regressions often did not provide the information we sought. As a result, some gaps are likely. We provide

detailed bibliographic information for readers who wish to learn more about a specific equation.
Most of the equations presented here were developed specifically for application to particular species at specific study sites, so they may be more accurate when used to estimate biomass at sites that closely resemble those for which they were developed. When biomass for a particular study site is the target variable, we recommend using a specific regression that is matched closely to the site rather than generalized regressions developed for large-scale application. If such an equation is not available, we recommend applying a range of sitespecific equations. This approach will provide a range of biomass estimates likely to include the actual (though

still unknown) biomass value for the target study site, and it will provide a simplistic estimate of the uncertainty inherent in these biomass calculations.
Database Description
This section includes definitions for the variables in the seven tables (Tables 3-9) that make up the database (Appendix B). The complete database also is available online at http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/global/. Table 3 lists more than 2,600 equations and their coefficients; each row in the table represents a separate biomass regression. (Only the first 10 pages of Table 3 are included in this report. Table 3 in its entirety is on the CD-ROM included with this publication and is available online.) Tables 4 through 9 contain supporting information.

Table 3: Equations and Parameters for Diameter-Based Biomass Equations
The printed version of the database contains only the first 10 pages of Table 3. The companion CD-ROM and electronic distributions of the database include Table 3 in its entirety along with Tables 4-9.
1. Species – Numeric code for the species to which the equation applies. This number corresponds to the species code listed in the online Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database (FIADB) as of October 2002 and to the “FIA Species code” variable (item 1) in Table 4. FIADB is available at http://fia.fs.fed.us/ dbrs_setup.html.
2. Common name – Common name for the species of interest (Table 4).
3. Component ID – Numeric code corresponding to the tree component of interest. These codes and their definitions are listed in Table 5.
4. Equation Form ID – Numeric code corresponding to the algebraic form of the equation used by the original author to fit the regression. These codes and their associated equation forms are listed in Table 6.
5. Coefficients and constants (a - e) – These columns include parameters for the regression equations as given by the authors of the original regressions. The parameter definitions refer to letter codes in Table 6.
6. Diameter – Independent variable used to develop the regression. Definitions: BA: Basal area, the cross-sectional area of the stem at breast height. BArc: Basal area, the cross-sectional area of the stem at the root collar. c.b.h.: Circumference at breast height. c.r.c.: Circumference at root collar. d.b.h.: Diameter at breast height at 4.5 feet (1.37 m) above ground level. d.b.h.2: Square of diameter at breast height. d.r.c.: Diameter at root collar. d150: Diameter at 150 cm above ground level.
7. Corrected for bias – A “yes” value in this column means that the original authors developed and reported a correction factor to compensate for the potential underestimation resulting from backtransforming logarithmic predictions to arithmetic units, as suggested by Baskerville (1972), Beauchamp and Olson (1973), and Sprugel (1983). In many

cases where (7) is “yes,” item (8) will list CF, the bias correction factor to be used. In other cases, the authors embedded the correction factor into the equation parameters, or did not publish the value of CF since it can be obtained from the regression statistics. In such cases, the value of CF in the database will be zero even though the authors used the correction factor.
A “no” value in this column means that: a) the equation form used is not logarithmic and does not require the correction; b) for logarithmic equation forms, the authors chose not to correct the equation; c) there is no mention of bias correction in the original publication.
8. Bias correction (CF) – Published value of CF, to correct for potential underestimation resulting from back-transformation of logarithmic predictions to arithmetic units. As a remedy for bias, it has been proposed that the back-transformed biomass results be multiplied by CF, defined as exp(MSE/2), where MSE refers to the mean squared error of a line fit by least-squares regression. The use of CF has been criticized; because many authors include wellreasoned discussions of their choice whether to use the correction, we follow the example of the original authors. If the author reports the CF, we also report it here; if the author uses it but does not report it explicitly, we do likewise; or if the original author chooses not to address the issue, we reflect that decision as well.
9. r and R2 – Standard goodness-of-fit statistics, if these were reported by the authors of the original regressions.
10. MinDiameter and MaxDiameter – Minimum and maximum diameter values (in centimeters) for which the regression is valid. These are the minimum and maximum measurements for the trees harvested to develop the regression.
11. Sample size – Number of trees harvested or measured to develop the regression.
12. Stump height – For equations that predict the biomass of any component that includes the tree stem or the stump, this variable lists (in inches) the estimated or measured stump height. Many authors, particularly those reporting in the ecology literature, did not report this value, so we developed a series of rules to estimate it if missing. If the original authors reported stump height, it is listed here. If no stump height was given or if the authors did not mention the existence of a stump in their publication, we

4

assumed that the stump was 6 inches (15.24 cm) tall. Stump height was assumed to be zero if any of the following were true: 1) the methods of Whittaker and Marks (1975) or Whittaker and Woodwell (1968) were used for sampling (these authors were explicit about felling trees at groundline); 2) the authors stated that trees were “felled at groundline” as opposed to simply being “felled;” 3) the stump is described as “as short as possible;” 4) the same authors also report an equation for root biomass only (versus stump plus root biomass); 5) the authors estimated (using their own method) that portion of the stump excluded when the trees were felled; 6) the trees used to develop the regressions were small enough that it is reasonable to expect that nearly the entire stump would have been included with the aboveground biomass using standard destructive harvesting techniques adapted for research purposes.
13. Top d.o.b. – For equations that include a portion of the merchantable stem, describes the minimum diameter outside bark (d.o.b.) of the top of the merchantable stem. If a value was listed, it is included here. If no value was listed, or if the equation was listed as predicting the biomass of the “stem” or the “bole” with no discussion of the limiting top diameter, we assumed that the value of this parameter was zero. Some authors provided ratio equations allowing for prediction of certain bole components based on a user-defined top diameter; in these cases the value of “Ratio Equation,” (item 17) is “y” and the corresponding equation is listed in Table 7.
14. Units diameter and units biomass – The units used by the original authors to measure the independent and dependent variables. The equation coefficients in Table 3 are reported as originally published: this means that the diameter units must correspond to the units in the Units diameter column, and that the result always is in the units listed in the Units biomass column. Abbreviations:
mm: millimeters (= 10-3 meters)
cm: centimeters (= 10-2 meters)
m: meters (= 39.37 inches)
in: inches (= 2.54 cm)
lb: pounds (= 0.4545 kg)
g: grams
kg: kilograms (= 106 grams)
Mg: Megagrams (= 109 grams)
15. Component – This column can be used to determine whether an equation was incorporated into the generalized equations published by Jenkins

et al. (2003). If an equation was used in the generalized equations, the codes in this column further describe modifications to incorporate equations into the generalized equations. Values are defined as (see also Figure 1):
na: Not used in the generalized equations, usually because component definitions were inconsistent with what was required. Exclusion for other reasons is stated in the Notes column.
ag: Predicts total aboveground biomass; used directly in the analysis with no alteration.
sb: Merchantable stem bark biomass with the correct definition (12-inch stump to 4-inch top); used directly with no alteration.
sw: Merchantable stem wood biomass with the correct definition (12-inch stump to 4-inch top); used directly with no alteration.
fl: Total foliage biomass; used directly with no alteration.
rt: Root biomass; used directly with no alteration. Due to the scarcity of root biomass equations, root diameter limits were ignored in the summary paper (Jenkins et al. 2003).
agm: Predicts above-stump biomass; stump biomass was added before the equation was used to predict aboveground biomass in the summary paper.
sbm: Merchantable stem bark biomass with a portion of the stump included; stump biomass was subtracted before the equation was used to predict merchantable stem bark biomass in the summary paper.
swm: Merchantable stem wood biomass with a portion of the stump included; stump biomass was subtracted before the equation was used to predict merchantable stem wood in the summary paper.
flm: Predicts a portion of total foliage biomass (usually new or old foliage biomass); two or more equations (including this one) were added to predict total foliage biomass in the summary paper.
rtm: Predicts root plus stump biomass; stump biomass was subtracted before the equation was used in the summary paper.
rts: Complete tree biomass; aboveground biomass (as predicted by the same authors) was subtracted before the equation was used to predict root biomass in the summary paper.
16. Component sum – Describes the additive status for equations where the original authors published separate component equations. Definitions are:
a: This equation predicts total aboveground or abovestump biomass, and was used directly or with

5

modifications to account for stump biomass in the summary paper.
b: This equation predicts total belowground biomass, and was used with no alteration in the summary paper.
t: Along with other equations published for the same species by the same author, this component adds to total aboveground or total above-stump biomass. No separate aboveground or above-stump equation is presented based on the same data. For these equations, the additive result is included in the summary paper.
c: Together with other equations published for the same species by the same author, this component adds to total aboveground, above-stump, or complete-tree biomass. A separate aboveground or above-stump equation (with an “a” in this column) also is presented based on the same data. For these equations, only the aboveground or above-stump equation is included in the summary paper.
s: Together with other equations published for the same species by the same author, this component adds to total belowground biomass. No separate total belowground biomass equation is presented based on the same data. For these equations, only the additive result is included in the analysis of Jenkins et al. (2003).
r: Together with other components, this component adds to total belowground biomass. A separate total belowground biomass equation (with a “b” in this column) is also presented based on the same data. For these equations, only the additive result is used in Jenkins et al. (2003).
A blank in this column means that the equation was not used in the summary paper because the components do not add to a total or this equation does not contribute to a total, or the equation was deemed unsuitable for another reason (which would be described in the Notes column).
17. Ratio equation – Some authors presented methods for predicting the biomass of the merchantable stem to a user-defined top diameter. A “y” value in this column means that a separate ratio equation was presented by this author and is included in Table 7. Where available, these equations were used to estimate the biomass of the corresponding merchantable stem to a 4-inch top d.o.b.
18. Segmented equation – Some authors presented paired equations for the same species such that one equation was applicable at the lower end of the diameter range and a second equation was applicable

at the upper end of the range. A “y” value in this column means that the equation is one-half of a segmented equation; its companion equation for the same species will have the same author and regression statistics but will be applicable over a different diameter range. In Jenkins et al. (2003), each half of a segmented equation was used for half of the total number of pseudodata predictions for a given author and species combination.
19. Equation number – Some authors presented several equations for the same component and species based on treatment type or study site. In such cases, each separate equation is given a number, starting sequentially with 1. When an author presented equations based on independent tree samples from different sites, all of the published equations were included in Jenkins et al. (2003). However, if the same author also presented one equation based on “pooled” data from all sites sampled, the pooled equation was used.
20. Source – Numbers correspond to references listed in Table 9.
21. Notes – Information potentially of interest to users of the equations.
Table 4: Species Key, Suggested Assignments for Species Groups to Apply Generalized Equations, and Specific Gravity Information
Table 4 includes the species-specific information relevant to users of the database, as well as species-specific information used to develop the generalized equations described in Jenkins et al. (2003).
1. FIA species code – Numeric code assigned to each tree species; used by FIA’s FIADB database. Note that some equations were added to the database for species that are either not native or uncommon in the United States. For these species with no dedicated FIA codes, we assigned a code for use in this biomass database. As a result, the new ID’s probably will not match the assigned FIA code should these species ever be added to the FIADB database. The codes for these new species are listed in bold italic. Family, genus, and species information in this database should allow users to assign the correct FIA code if necessary.
2. Common name – Common name used by FIA (or in common usage for species not listed by FIA) for the species.
3. Family

6

4. Genus
5. Species
6. Species group – The group to which the species was assigned to develop the generalized equations of Jenkins et al. (2003). If no biomass regressions are found for a particular species, this column can be used to assign species to groups when applying the generalized equations. Abbreviations are: aa = aspen / alder / cottonwood / willow; cl = cedar / larch; df = Douglas-fir; mb = soft maple / birch; mh = mixed hardwood; mo = hard maple / oak / hickory / beech; pi = pine; sp = spruce; tf = true fir / hemlock; wo = woodland species (juniper / oak / mesquite).
7. Wood specific gravity – Specific gravity (based on oven-dry weight and green volume) value used to convert stump volume inside bark to stump wood biomass for standardizing component definitions in Jenkins et al. (2003). Values were obtained primarily from the Forest Products Laboratory (U.S. Dep. Agric. 1974) and Markwardt (1930). Where this column is blank, data for the species (or species group) were unavailable. For groups of species (e.g., pine spp. or spruce spp.) the value is the average of specific gravity values from the literature for species that make up the group.
8. Bark specific gravity – Specific gravity (based on oven-dry weight and green volume) value used to convert stump bark volume to stump bark biomass for standardizing component definitions in Jenkins et al. (2003). The bibliographic source of the information is listed in the next column (and in Appendix A). Where this column is blank, data for the species (or species group) were unavailable.
9. Bark specific gravity source – Reference number corresponding to the bibliographic source that lists the bark specific gravity for the species. Note that information on bark specific gravity is limited. Where a value for specific gravity is included in the previous column but is not accompanied by a code referring to the source of the information, bark specific gravity was estimated based on data from the literature. Unless there was information on bark specific gravity from a closely related species or group of species, we assumed that bark and wood specific gravity were similar.
10. Stump volume equation – FIA species code corresponding to the equation used for predicting stump volume inside and outside bark for this species to standardize component definitions in the

summary paper. Species with no value in this column were not used to develop the generalized equations in Jenkins et al. (2003). See Table 8 and Raile (1982) for stump volume equations.
Table 5: Tree Component Key Table 5 describes the tree components included in the equation database, and serves as the key for the “Component ID” column in Table 3.
1. Component description – Describes the tree component predicted by the equation.
2. Component abbreviation – Used by the developers of the BIOPAK database (Means et al. 1994) for referring to plant component biomass. Where this column is blank, the BIOPAK database did not include equations for the component.
3. Component ID – Numeric code corresponding to the component; the number in this column refers to the Component ID column in Table 3.
Table 6: Equation Form Key Table 6 includes the general equation forms in the equation database, and serves as the key for the “Equation form ID” column in Table 3.
1. Equation form description – This column shows the algebraic form of the equation. To use an equation plug the coefficients and constants listed in Table 3 into the equation form. Note that “dia” refers to the diameter measurement listed in Table 3, whether it is basal area, d.b.h., or circumference at the root collar.
2. Equation form ID – Numeric code corresponding to the equation form; the number in this column refers to the Equation form ID column in Table 3.
Table 7: Parameters for Stem Ratio Equations for Selected Stem Biomass Equations Table 7 includes parameters for equations used to develop merchantable-stem biomass to a user-specific top diameter. These ratio equations were developed and presented by the authors of a subset of the original equations included in the database. A stem ratio equation is included here for any equation in Table 3 with a value of “y” in the “Ratio equation” column.
1. Source – Numeric code corresponding to the bibliographic reference where the equation was published (these numbers correspond to those in Table 9).

7

2. Species – Numeric code corresponding to the species for which the equation was developed (species codes are listed in Table 4).
3. Component – Numeric code corresponding to the tree component for which the ratio equation was developed. The original authors developed these ratio equations for Component ID’s 6 (st, merchantablestem wood plus bark) and 4 (sw, merchantable-stem wood) (see Table 5 for Component descriptions). The biomass of merchantable-stem bark (Component ID 5) can be found by difference.
4. a, b, c – Parameters for ratio equations. The equation form is:
ln(ratio) = a * (db) * (Dc)
where ratio = proportion of above-stump stem biomass to specific top d.o.b.
d = specified top d.o.b. (inches)
D = tree d.b.h. (inches)
a, b, c = equation parameters from Table 7
When back-transformed, the result of this equation is a number between 0 and 1. When the original total stem (or stem wood) biomass developed using the equation presented in Table 3 is multiplied by the ratio determined with this equation, the result is the stem biomass to the top d.o.b. (d) specified by the user.
Table 8: Stump Diameter Regression Coefficients, Outside and Inside Bark, for Tree Species in the Lake States
Table 8 includes parameters for equations used to estimate stump volume based on d.b.h., for tree species in the Lake States (Raile 1982). When developing the generalized equations of Jenkins et al. (2003), stump volume (and biomass) was computed in two cases. In the first, a given equation might report biomass of the above-stump portion of the tree (Component ID 3 in Tables 3 and 5); here, the biomass of the stump between ground level and stump height was computed and added to the above-stump equation to determine total aboveground biomass. In the second case, an equation reporting merchantable stem (or merchantable stem wood or bark) biomass might give a stump height of 6 inches or 3 inches. The definition of merchantable stem in Jenkins et al. (2003) specifies a 12-inch stump height. Here, the biomass of the portion of the stump between reported stump height and 1 foot was computed and subtracted from the merchantable stem biomass from the reported equation in order to standardize merchantable stem definitions for the generalized equations.

To compute stump wood biomass, we first predicted stump volume, assuming that the portion of the stump to be added or subtracted from the biomass equation result was a perfect cylinder. Due to the tapered shape of most trees, this approach likely underestimated slightly the biomass of the bottom stump portion. However, this overestimation probably was balanced nearly equally by an overestimation of the biomass of the top half of the stump portion.
To determine stump wood volume, we chose a point that bisected the length of the stump portion of interest, and used the parameters given in Table 8 to predict stump inside bark diameter (d.i.b.) at that point. We then used a standard geometric formula for predicting the volume of a cylinder to predict the wood volume of the stump portion of interest: Volume = pi * r2 * h, where r = (stump d.i.b.)/2 and h = the length of the stump portion.
This wood volume was multiplied by the wood specific gravity for the species of interest (Table 4) to determine oven-dry stump wood biomass.
Stump bark volume was found by difference. We began by using the parameters in Table 8 to predict stump outside bark diameter (d.o.b.) at a point in the middle of the stump portion of interest. We used the standard geometric formula described previously to predict the volume of the entire stump (bark plus wood). We then subtracted the volume of the stump wood only (found using the geometric method described above) from total stump volume to determine the volume of the stump bark only. This volume was multiplied by the specific gravity of bark for the species of interest to determine oven-dry stump bark biomass.

Using the Database
For clarity, we provide two examples of how one might apply the equations in the database: estimating total foliage biomass for a study plot in Maine, and estimating the potential error associated with using a particular equation for aboveground biomass for Douglas-fir.
Maine Example
Choosing appropriate equations
In this example, we have species and d.b.h. data for diverse tree species on a Maine study plot. We want to quantify the foliage biomass (dry weight, green foliage) for this plot using an allometric approach. In Table 5 we see that Component ID 18 refers to total foliage, while Component ID’s 19 and 20 refer to “new” and “old” foliage, respectively. (For a tree that retains its leaves or needles for more than 1 year, note that new foliage is the current year’s growth while old foliage is growth from the previous year and earlier.) Because we are most interested in the total foliage biomass, we look in the Component ID column in Table 3 for equations that correspond to Component ID 18. There are 295 “total foliage” equations for a variety of species and study sites. Our study plot is in Maine, so we want to use equations from studies conducted in that region. We check Table 9 for the geographic origins of the equations, and we find that several of the total foliage equations were developed from trees harvested in Maine: the equations from Ribe (1973) (ref 130) and Young (1980) (ref 177) probably are the most widely applicable for that state. We note that the Ribe (1973) equations have a fairly limited diameter range (for most of these equations, the minimum diameter is 2.5 cm and the maximum diameter is 15.24 cm) and that the Young (1980) equations were developed from trees harvested over a larger range of diameters. If our trees are small, we might use the Ribe (1973) equations; if our trees are intermediate in size, the Young (1980) equations might be more appropriate. If tree species in our study plot are not represented by either set of references or if our Maine plot is near the New Hampshire border, we may want to use some of the equations developed in New Hampshire, e.g., the Hocker and Earley (1983) (ref 74) or Kinerson and Bartholomew (1977) (ref 86) equations.
Applying the equations
Once we have examined the species and size distributions in our study plot to determine consistency with the equations in Table 3 and chosen a set of equations, we must estimate foliage biomass from the d.b.h. data in our study plot. For example, we are using the Ribe

Figure 2.—Total aboveground biomass as predicted from five allometric regression equations for Douglas-fir.

(1973) equation to calculate biomass for a red maple (Acer rubrum) (FIA species code 316) that is 5 cm d.b.h.
This equation has Equation Form ID 1. In Table 6, we see that Equation Form ID 1 corresponds to equations with the following form: log10 biomass = a + b * log10(dia)c. We also note that “dia” in the Ribe equation refers to d.b.h. (as listed in the Diameter column in Table 3), and that Units Diameter and Units Biomass for the equation we have chosen (Table 3) are in inches and grams, respectively. Therefore, we must convert our d.b.h. measurement to inches and we recognize that the result will be in grams.
First, we convert the d.b.h. measurement to inches: 5 cm * (1 inch/ 2.54 cm) = 1.97 inches. To calculate foliage biomass, we apply the equation: log10 biomass = 2.1237 + (1.8015)*(log10(1.97)) = 2.65. Since log10(biomass) = 2.65, to find total foliage biomass for this stem we must back-transform the logarithm to arithmetic units: biomass = 10 , 2.65 or 451 g.
We would repeat this process for each stem and species for which we want to estimate foliage biomass. To calculate the total foliage biomass on the study plot, we sum the foliage estimates for all the trees present on the plot.

Douglas-Fir Example
In this example, we want to understand the implications of using a particular equation for predicting Douglas-fir biomass. How would our results be different if we used one equation instead of another? We suggest applying several equations to the same tree or set of trees, and quantifying the differences among the results. For example, sorting Table 3 by Species and Component ID, we see that there are six equations for total aboveground biomass (Component ID 2) for Douglas-fir (species code 202). Also, one of these equations requires estimates of diameter at the root collar (d.r.c.) rather than d.b.h. If we have only d.b.h. data, we would omit this equation from our analysis unless we had a method for predicting d.b.h. from d.r.c. In this example, we would choose the equations from Table 3 that correspond to the diameter range of interest and use all of them to quantify aboveground biomass. The differences can be expressed in terms of percentages (e.g., results from one equation are X% higher than the average of all of the appropriate equations). We also might graph the equations as in Figure 2, with the d.b.h. values on the x axis and the biomass values on the y axis. This allows us to see the differences between the estimates provided by the different equations.
