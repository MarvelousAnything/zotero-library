Allometry: The Study of Biological Scaling

  title={Allometry: The Study of Biological Scaling}, 
  author={}, 
  year={2018}

    Published 2018  
 
Allometry, in its broadest sense, describes how the characteristics of living creatures change with size. The term originally referred to the scaling relationship between the size of a body part and the size of the body as a whole, as both grow during development. However, more recently the meaning of the term allometry has been modified and expanded to refer to biological scaling relationships in general, be it for morphological traits (e.g., the relationship between brain size and body size…  Expand

Breaking the Scale: Allometric scaling analysis in Carnivoran families 
 
    S. Navaratnam , J. B. Phillips 
    Biology 
    2021  
 
TLDR 
A phylogenetically generalised least squares analysis using life history information largely from the Pantheria dataset suggests that PGLS analyses are informative at the family level, and the absence of scaling can provide insight to understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that work on the family taxonomic level or below.

Ecological and evolutionary implications of allometric growth in stomach size of brachyuran crabs 
 
    B. Griffen , Z. Cannizzo , M. Gül 
    Medicine, Biology 
    PloS one 
    2018  
 
TLDR 
The results highlight potential divergent strategies in stomach growth taken by different groups of crabs and highlight potential limitations that may be imposed on the ability of this group of organisms to respond to warming trends expected with climate change. Expand

Can multitrophic interactions shape morphometry, allometry, and fluctuating asymmetry of seed-feeding insects? 
 
    Tamires Camila Talamonte de Oliveira , Angelo Monteiro , L. Faria 
    Biology, Medicine 
    PloS one 
    2020  
 
TLDR 
Evaluating the effect of fruit infestation, parasitism rate, and seed biomass on size, allometric and asymmetric patterns of morphological structures of insects that exploit the same resource shows that both allometry and morphological trait measurements are the most indicated in studies focused on interactions and morphometry.

    Biology 
    Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 
    2019  
 
TLDR 
Statistically significant results were found in all the trunk segments, meaning that these body units grow proportionally correlated with the body, contrary to the results obtained for the spines. Expand

Scaling of bird wings and feathers for efficient flight

    Medicine, Mathematics 
    Science Advances 
    2019  
 
TLDR 
The scaling trends of bird wings in connection with their flight performance are explored and the tensile strength of avian bone is hypothesized to be a limiting factor in scaling the humerus with mass, which is corroborated by its experimentally determined allometric scaling trend. Expand

Inter-Specific Relationship of Size and Walking Speed in Predaceous Ladybirds (Insecta: Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)

    Biology 
    Current Science 
    2018  
 
TLDR 
The giant ladybird species showed significantly higher positive allometry in body volume and slower speed for giant size when compared to species of smaller sizes which usually forage for short-lived aphid colonies in seasonal and annual habitats of crop plants and weeds. Expand

TLDR 
This review discusses the methods of characterizing body and organ shape, the developmental programs thought to underlie each, highlight when and how the mechanisms regulating body andorgan shape might overlap, and provides the perspective on future avenues of research. Expand

A quadratic approach to allometry yields promising results for the study of growth 
 
    E. Geraert 
    Biology 
    2020  
 
TLDR 
By using the quadratic parabola there is no need to postulate "sudden changes in the growth curve" and so it appears that HUXLEY's power curve can be abandoned. Expand

TLDR 
It is found that lower larval densities resulted in larger antennae suggesting that this species predicts future environmental conditions based on larval rearing conditions and adapt their adult morphology to maximise fitness. Expand
