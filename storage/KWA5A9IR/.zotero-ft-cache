RBA warns Russia-Ukraine war will trigger new wave of inflation and possible interest rate rises

Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe has warned Russia's invasion of Ukraine will send a new wave of inflation around the world.
Key points:

    The Russia-Ukraine war has sent commodity prices soaring
    Global supply chains have been severely disrupted
    It will send a wave of new inflation around the world

He has also warned the psychological impact of the fresh round of price rises could change peoples' expectations for how high inflation will be in the future.

He said this was a "critical issue" because, if people started to believe that prices would keep rising, it could challenge the ability for central banks to keep inflation under control.

"The war in Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia have created a new supply shock that is pushing prices up, especially for commodities," Dr Lowe said in a speech at the AFR Business Summit on Wednesday.

"This new supply shock will extend the period of inflation being above central banks’ targets.

    "This runs the risk that the low-inflation psychology that has characterised many advanced economies over the past two decades starts to shift.

"If so, the higher inflation would be more persistent and broad-based, and require a larger monetary policy response."

Dr Lowe said, at the moment, financial market pricing suggested that consumer price inflation (CPI) would decline from its current high rates in the North Atlantic economies to around 2 per cent without "real interest rates" ever going into positive territory.

"[But] a shift in inflation psychology would challenge this view, so this is a critical issue," he added.

The inflation expectations of a range of groups in Australia — including consumers, union officials, and market economists — had already picked up a little before the Russia-Ukraine war.

Russia-Ukraine war supply shock

Dr Lowe said the Russia-Ukraine war had created a new "supply shock" by sending prices soaring for key commodities such as crude oil and gas.

Crude oil and thermal coal prices were already up by 40 per cent, he observed, and the prices of base metals such as nickel and aluminium were up even more sharply in some cases.

Agricultural commodities had also been affected, with the price of wheat in global markets rising by 40 per cent since the start of February.

"For the countries in Europe, this rise in commodity prices represents a negative shock to their terms of trade and thus to their national income," he said.

    "This alone will cause a slowdown in economic activity.

"It will also cause CPI inflation to be higher than it would have otherwise been."

He said the immediate impact on Australia's economy would be different from Europe, because Australia exports many of the commodities whose prices were rising.

That meant Australia's terms of trade would rise in coming months, providing a boost to our national income with higher profits for resource companies and higher tax revenue.

However, consumers would suffer from rising petrol and other prices.

    "This will eat into household budgets, push up costs for many businesses and crimp spending in some areas."

Could the Russia-Ukraine conflict threaten globalisation?

The Russia-Ukraine conflict could blow apart the global economic order, including its supply chains, writes Gareth Hutchens.

Dr Lowe said, before the war, the world's supply chains had started to show signs that bottlenecks were easing, but now those plans had been thrown into disarray by new supply challenges due to the conflict and sanctions on Russia.

"Delivery times had shortened a bit, global car production was increasing again and the prices of semiconductors had come off their peaks," he said.

"Businesses were also responding with new investment and changes in processes to ease capacity constraints.

"These developments were providing a basis for expecting that supply-side inflation pressures would ease over time, both globally and here in Australia."

He said the next RBA board meeting would have to discuss the changed global circumstances, because the risks of inflation had "certainly moved to the upside."

"Headline inflation is going to be higher (in Australia)," he said.

"I think it'll have a number with a four in front sometime this year, as the higher oil prices flow through.

"The issue we're grappling with is, is this a temporary increase in the level of prices or is it a period of ongoing increases?

"And the answer to that is still unknown."

Dr Lowe said the catastrophic floods on Australia's east coast would also have a negative impact on some prices this year.

"We will see higher prices for many fruits and vegetables, the supply chains have been interrupted again and some of the growing areas have been very adversely affected," he said.
Consumer confidence declines significantly

The latest Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment survey was released on Wednesday.

It showed consumer sentiment has fallen into negative territory for the first time since September 2020.

The survey was conducted between February 28 and March 4, so it captured most of the response to the south-east Queensland and Northern NSW floods, but was too early for most of the current disasters in greater Sydney.

The survey shows consumers are getting more nervous about economic conditions over the next 12 months, and over the next five years.

Risk aversion has become firmly entrenched, with more than half of respondents saying the wisest thing to do with any savings now is to keep them in bank deposits or pay down debt.

"While Covid-19 is now less of a concern for consumers, bad news around higher inflation, impending interest rate rises, rising petrol prices, flooding in Australia and the war in Ukraine would all weigh on consumers," said Diana Mousina, AMP Investments senior economist.

Dr Lowe said it was "plausible" that the cash rate target would be increased "later this year.”

It is currently sitting at 0.1 per cent.
