Biden Joins Europe in Punishing Russia With Sanctions

Washington and its allies called the Kremlin’s recognition of two separatist regions a blunt defiance of international law that risks war. Western officials said Russian troops have entered eastern Ukraine.

U.S. and allies impose sanctions on Russia as Biden condemns the ‘invasion’ of Ukraine.

WASHINGTON — The United States and its allies on Tuesday swiftly imposed economic sanctions on Russia for what President Biden denounced as the beginning of an “invasion of Ukraine,” unveiling a set of coordinated punishments as Western officials confirmed that Russian forces had begun crossing the Ukrainian border.

Speaking from the White House, Mr. Biden condemned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and said the immediate consequences for his aggression against Ukraine included the loss of a key natural gas pipeline and cutting off global financing to two Russian banks and a handful of the country’s elites.

“Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbors?” Mr. Biden said on Tuesday afternoon, joining a cascade of criticism from global leaders earlier in the day. “This is a flagrant violation of international law and demands a firm response from the international community.”

Mr. Biden warned Mr. Putin that more sanctions would follow if the Russian leader did not withdraw his forces and engage in diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis.

But that prospect remained dim by the end of the day, as Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken canceled plans to meet with the Russian foreign minister on Thursday, saying that it does not “make sense” to hold talks while Russian forces are on the move.

“To put it simply, Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine,” Mr. Biden said, adding, “He’s setting up a rationale to take more territory by force.”

The global response began early on Tuesday, just hours after Mr. Putin recognized the self-declared separatist states in eastern Ukraine and Russian forces started rolling into their territory, according to NATO, European Union and White House officials. It was the first major deployment of Russian troops across the internationally recognized border since the current crisis began.

At a news conference in Moscow, Mr. Putin said that he had not decided to send in troops “right at this moment.” But officials said the invasion started overnight, just hours before Mr. Putin’s Parliament formally granted him the authority to deploy the military abroad. Ukrainians near the territory controlled by Kremlin-backed separatists have already endured days of shelling, and as Ukrainian troops hunkered down in their trenches and civilians took shelter in basements, the country’s military said that one soldier had been killed so far and six wounded.

Financial markets around the world wobbled on Tuesday in the wake of the Russian actions and the response from Western governments. In the United States, the news pushed stocks lower, leaving the S&P 500 in correction territory, more than 10 percent below its January peak. Oil prices, which had risen to nearly $100 a barrel in anticipation of a global disruption, settled at $96.84 a barrel, up 1.5 percent.

Mr. Biden and his counterparts in Germany, England and other European nations described the package of global sanctions as severe. They include financial directives by the United States to deny Russia the ability to borrow money in Western markets and to block financial transactions by two banks and the families of three wealthy Russian elites.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany put the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline on hold . The $11 billion conduit from Russia to Germany — completed but not yet operational — is crucial to Moscow’s plans to increase energy sales to Europe. European Union foreign ministers and the British government approved sanctions against legislators in Moscow who voted to authorize the use of force, as well as Russian elites, companies and organizations.

“It will hurt a lot,” said the E.U. foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles.

The governments of Japan, Taiwan and Singapore also issued a joint statement saying they would limit technology exports to Russia in an effort to pressure Mr. Putin with damaging restrictions on his ambitions to compete in high-tech industries.

But the moves in Washington and other capitals around the world were limited in scope and fell short of the more sweeping economic warfare that some — including members of Congress and other supporters of Ukraine — have repeatedly demanded in recent weeks.

Mr. Biden and his counterparts have said they must balance the need to take swift and severe action with preserving the possibility of even greater sanctions on Russia if Mr. Putin escalates the conflict by trying to seize more territory claimed by the separatists, or even the entire country — a war that could kill tens of thousands of people.

“This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine,” he said, adding that “we’ll continue to escalate sanctions if Russia escalates.”

European leaders also vowed to get tougher if Mr. Putin’s forces continued to advance. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described British sanctions as just “the first tranche.”

Mr. Biden’s use of the word “invasion” was significant. In the past, he had angered the Ukrainian leadership when he suggested that there might be lesser penalties for a “minor incursion.” Now that Mr. Putin has ordered forces into eastern Ukraine, Mr. Biden, in his choice of words, is making clear that there is nothing minor about the operation.

But that still leaves open the question of how to calibrate the sanctions — because so far there have been no mass casualties. Jonathan Finer, the president’s deputy national security adviser, said early Tuesday that the administration could hold back some of its promised punishments in the hopes of deterring further, far more violent aggression by Mr. Putin aimed at taking the rest of the country.

“We’ve always envisioned waves of sanctions that would unfold over time in response to steps Russia actually takes, not just statements that they make,” Mr. Finer said on CNN. “We’ve always said we’re going to watch the situation on the ground and have a swift and severe response.”

Crucially, it remains unclear how far Mr. Putin — who has argued that Ukraine itself is a phony country, wrongly carved away from Russia — is prepared to go. On Tuesday, he said ominously that he recognized the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk republics’ sovereignty over not only the land they control, but also the much larger portion of Ukraine that they lay claim to, home to 2.5 million people.

At a hastily called news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Putin demanded that Ukraine vow never to join NATO, give up the advanced weapons the West has delivered to it, recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea and negotiate directly with the Luhansk and Donetsk separatists, who are seen in Kyiv and Western capitals as illegitimate Kremlin proxies.

“The most important point is a known degree of demilitarization of Ukraine today,” Mr. Putin said. “This is the only objectively controllable factor that can be observed and reacted to.”

A deputy Russian defense minister, Nikolai Pankov, claimed that Ukraine had gathered 60,000 troops to attack the Russia-backed separatist enclaves in the country’s east — a step that Ukraine denies having any plans to take. Mr. Pankov’s remarks offered little evidence that a peaceful end to the conflict between the two countries was in sight.

“Negotiations have reached a dead end,” he said in a televised speech. “The Ukrainian leadership has taken the path of violence and bloodshed.”

Mr. Biden’s announcement of the new sanctions was equally grim. He said the United States was imposing “full blocking” on two large Russian financial institutions and “comprehensive sanctions” on Russian debt.

“That means we’ve cut off Russia’s government from Western finance,” he said. “It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets, either.”

He also said that the United States would impose sanctions on Russian elites and their families, an effort to ensure that those closest to Mr. Putin do not escape the financial pain that is expected to hit hard for average Russian citizens.

Daleep Singh, a deputy national security adviser, called the sanctions announced on Tuesday “only the sharp edge of the pain we can inflict.”

Mr. Singh described the two banks as a “glorified piggy bank of the Kremlin” and a financier “of the activities of the Russian military.” The banks will be prohibited from making transactions in the United States or Europe, and their assets in the U.S. will be frozen.

Mr. Singh said the sanctions against the Russian elites and their families would punish those who “shared in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin, and they will now share in the pain.”

American officials have worried for weeks that imposing severe sanctions on Russia could also have consequences in the United States, including higher gas prices. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said Americans should be prepared for the conflict with Russia to have that result.

Asked about Mr. Biden’s proposed summit with Mr. Putin, Ms. Psaki said the administration was still open to diplomacy. “That remains an option,” she said of a potential meeting, but only if Russia de-escalates hostilities toward Ukraine.

By day’s end in eastern Ukraine, there was no immediate sign of major military escalation, but fearful Ukrainians boarded buses out of the separatist areas as the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, urged his nation to “keep a cool head” in the crisis.

Mr. Zelensky insisted that Ukraine would not yield territory, and his defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, appeared to be girding his country’s troops for battle.

“Ahead will be a difficult trial,” Mr. Reznikov said in a somber message released by the military. “There will be losses. You will have to go through pain and overcome fear and despondency.”

‘None of us should be fooled’: President Biden’s speech on Russia.

Here is a lightly edited transcript of President Biden’s speech on Tuesday from the East Room of the White House announcing new sanctions against Russia for what he called “the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.”

Well, good afternoon. Yesterday Vladimir Putin recognized two regions of Ukraine as independent states. And he bizarrely asserted that these regions are longer part of Ukraine and they’re sovereign territory. To put it simply: Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine.

Last night, Putin authorized Russian forces to deploy into these regions. Today he asserted that these regions actually extend deeper than the two areas he recognized, claiming large areas currently under the jurisdiction of the Ukraine government. He’s setting up a rationale to take more territory by force in my view. And if we listen to his speech last night, and many of you did, I know, he’s setting up a rationale to go much further. This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, as he indicated and asked permission to be able to do from his Duma.

So, let’s begin to — so, I’m going to begin to impose sanctions in response far beyond the steps we and our allies and partners implemented in 2014. And if Russia goes further with this invasion we stand prepared to go further as with sanctions. Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbors?

This is a flagrant violation of international law and demands a firm response from the international community. Over the last few months, we’ve coordinated closely with our NATO allies and partners in Europe and around the world to prepare that response. We’ve said all along, and I’ve told Putin to his face more than a month ago, that we would act together and the moment Russia moved against Ukraine. Russia has now undeniably moved against Ukraine by declaring these independent states.

So today, I’m announcing the first tranche of sanctions to impose costs on Russia in response to their actions yesterday. These have been closely coordinated with our allies and partners. We will continue to escalate sanctions if Russia escalates. We’re implementing full blocking sanctions on two large Russian financial institutions, VEB and their military bank.

We’re implementing sanctions on Russian’s sovereign debt. That means we’ve cut off Russia’s government from western financing. It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either.

Starting tomorrow, and continuing in the days ahead, we’ll also impose sanctions on Russia’s elites and their family members. They share in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies and should share in the pain as well.

Because of Russia’s actions, we’ve worked with Germany to ensure that Nord Stream 2 will not, as I promised, will not move forward. As Russia contemplates its next move, we have our next move prepared as well. Russia will pay a steeper price if it continues its aggression, including additional sanctions. The United States will continue to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine in the meantime and will continue to reinforce and reassure our NATO allies.

Today, in response to Russia’s admission that it will not withdraw its forces from Belarus, I have authorized the additional movements of U.S. Forces and equipment already stationed in Europe, to strengthen our Baltic allies Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

Let me be clear: These are totally defensive moves on our part. We have no intention of fighting Russia. We want to send an unmistakable message, though, that the United States, together with our allies, will defend every inch of NATO territory and abide by the commitments we made to NATO.

We still believe that Russia is poised to go much further in launching a massive military attack against Ukraine. I hope I’m wrong about that and I hope we’re wrong about that, but Russia has only escalated its threat against the rest of Ukrainian territory, including the major cities and the capital city of Kyiv. There are still well over 150,000 Russian troops surrounding Ukraine.

As I said, Russian forces remain positioned in Belarus to attack Ukraine from the north, including war planes and offensive missile systems. Russia’s moved troops closer to Ukraine’s border with Russia. Russia’s naval vessels are maneuvering in the Black Sea to Ukraine’s south including amphibious assault ships, missile cruisers and submarines. Russia’s moved supplies of blood and medical equipment into position on the border. You don’t need blood unless you plan on starting a war.

Over the last few days, we’ve seen much of the playbook that Secretary Blinken laid out last week in the United Nations Security Council come to pass. A major increase in military provocations, and false flag events along the line of contact in the Donbas, dramatically staged, conveniently on camera, meeting of Putin’s security council to grandstand for the Russian public. And now, political provocation of recognizing sovereign Ukrainian territory, so-called independent republics, in clear violation, again, of international law.

President Putin has sought authorization from the Russian Parliament to use military force outside of Russian territory. And this set the stage for further pretext of further provocations by Russia to try to justify further military action.

None of us, none of us should be fooled. None of us will be fooled. There is no justification. Further Russian assault of the Ukraine remains a severe threat in the days ahead. If Russia proceeds, it is Russia and Russia alone that bears the responsibility. As we respond, my administration is using every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers from rising prices at the pump.

As I said last week, defending freedom will have costs for us as well and here at home. We need to be honest about that. But as we will do — but as we do this, I’m going to take robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy not ours.

We’re monitoring energy supplies for any disruption. We’re executing a plan in coordination with major oil-producing consumers and producers toward a collective investment to secure stability and global energy supplies. This will be — this will blunt gas prices. I want to limit the pain to the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me.

In the last few days I’ve been in constant contact with European leaders, including with Ukrainian President Zelensky. Vice President Harris met in person with the leaders in Germany over the weekend at the Munich conference, including President Zelensky. At every step, we have shown the United States and our allies and partners are working in unison, which he hasn’t been counting on, Mr. Putin.

We’re united in our support of Ukraine. We are united in our opposition to Russian aggression. And we’re united in our resolve to defend our NATO alliance. And we’re united in our understanding of the urgency and seriousness of the threat Russia is making to global peace and stability.

Yesterday, the world heard clearly the full extent of Vladimir Putin’s twisted rewrite of history. Going back more than a century, as he waxed eloquently noting that, well, I’m not going to go into it — nothing in Putin’s lengthy remarks indicate any interest in pursuing real dialogue on European security in the year 2022.

He directly attacked Ukraine’s right to exist. He indirectly threatened territory formerly held by Russia, including nations that today are thriving democracies and members of NATO. He explicitly threatened war unless his extreme demands were met. And there’s no question that Russia is the aggressor.

So we’re clear eyed about the challenges we’re facing. Nonetheless, there is still time to avert the worse-case scenario that will bring untold suffering to millions of people if they move as suggested. The United States and our allies and partners remain open to diplomacy, if it is serious.

When all is said and done, we’re going to judge Russia by its actions, not its words. And whatever Russia does next, we’re ready to respond with unity, clarity, and conviction. I’ll probably have more to say about this as it moves on. I’m hoping diplomacy is still available.

Thank you all very much.

Trump, again cozying up to Putin, praises Russian aggression as ‘genius.’

As President Biden announced sanctions against Russia and warned of more if President Vladimir V. Putin did not withdraw his forces from Ukraine, former President Donald J. Trump on Tuesday praised Mr. Putin’s aggression as “genius” and called the Russian leader “very savvy” for describing the troops aligned on the Ukrainian border as peacekeepers.

Mr. Trump’s praise for a foreign adversary in a geopolitical confrontation with a sitting United States president was extraordinary for any former president, even one with a long history of cozying up to Mr. Putin, dating to his first presidential campaign.

In July 2016, Mr. Trump directly appealed to the Russians to hack the emails of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton , and make them public, the same day that the Russians made their first effort to break into the servers used by Mrs. Clinton’s personal office.

Once elected, Mr. Trump broke with decades of American precedent and repeatedly showed unusual deference toward Russia and expressed admiration for Mr. Putin, among other strongman leaders.

Weeks after taking office, Mr. Trump brushed aside Mr. Putin’s human rights transgressions during an interview with Bill O’Reilly , then of Fox News.

“You got a lot of killers,” he said. “What, you think our country’s so innocent?”

In 2018, Mr. Trump stood alongside Mr. Putin at the end of a summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland, and publicly challenged the conclusion of his own intelligence agencies that Moscow had interfered in the 2016 election, an enormous demonstration of trust in a leader accused of attacking American democracy.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump also ridiculed President Biden and accused him of failing to address Mr. Putin’s recognition late Monday of two Russia-backed separatist territories in Ukraine as independent republics, saying, “There was no response,” and calling this “very sad.”

Mr. Trump’s remarks were broadcast on a conservative talk radio show hosted by Clay Travis and Buck Sexton around the same time that Mr. Biden addressed the nation and announced a first set of sanctions against Russia.

Mr. Trump made no mention on the radio show of his impeachment in 2019 for a pressure campaign on Ukraine to incriminate Mr. Biden and aid his own re-election campaign, a charge he was acquitted of in the Republican-controlled Senate.

“Putin is now saying, ‘It’s independent,’ a large section of Ukraine. I said, ‘How smart is that?’ And he’s going to go in and be a peacekeeper,” Mr. Trump said. “That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re going to keep peace, all right. No, but think of it. Here’s a guy who’s very savvy.”

Since Mr. Trump left office, Republicans have split on how to respond to Russian aggression. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and others have called for harsh sanctions against Russia, while Trump supporters such as the Fox News host Tucker Carlson and J.D. Vance, a Senate candidate in Ohio, have argued that the United States should not punish Russia.

In a statement released Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump said the Russian aggression toward Ukraine would not have happened if he were still president.

During the radio interview, Mr. Trump said he and Mr. Putin had discussed a potential invasion of Ukraine when Mr. Trump was in the White House. “I knew that he always wanted Ukraine. I used to talk to him about it,” Mr. Trump said. “I said, ‘You can’t do it. You’re not going to do it.’ But I could see that he wanted it. I used to ask him. We used to talk about it at length.”

As the world waits in nervous anticipation of President Vladimir V. Putin’s next moves, the rhythm of daily life in Ukraine has already been affected by the intensifying conflict. Mr. Putin on Tuesday further laid the foundation for military conflict by declaring that Russia would recognize the sovereignty of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics , two breakaway territories, over the full territory that they claim.

The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, criticized Putin’s decision to recognize the independence of breakaway republics in Ukraine as an unacceptable “break in international law” on Tuesday night. “If you look back in history long enough, you will find many borders that were different in the past. If they were all to be discussed again, then we would have a very conflictual time ahead of us,” he said on public television.

E.U. adopts first sanctions and they will ‘hurt a lot,’ diplomat says.

BRUSSELS — Europe’s top diplomat said on Tuesday that European Union foreign ministers had adopted a first round of sanctions against Russian individuals and entities after President Vladimir V. Putin’s recognition of two breakaway regions in Eastern Ukraine .

“This package of sanctions that has been approved by unanimity with the member states will hurt Russia, and it will hurt a lot,” Josep Borrell Fontelles, the high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy, told the press after a meeting of the ministers in Paris.

In recent weeks, Europe has been struggling to present a united front against Russia. Europe has important trade ties with Russia and is dependent on Russian gas supplies, both of which could come under pressure if Russia invades Ukraine. Mr. Putin has sought to sow divisions in the E.U., and in the past wielded Russian energy as a geopolitical weapon.

At stake for Europe is whether it can allow Mr. Putin to upend the security structure that has helped buttress peace on the continent over several decades.

Appearing resolute, Mr. Borrell said that the sanctions would target the 351 members of the Russian Parliament, as well as 27 individuals and entities that are “playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukrainian territorial integrity.”

E.U. sanctions would focus on a number of areas related to Russia’s recognition of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics , including individual decision makers and other actors threatening Ukraine; defense-sector individuals and companies or government agencies playing a role in the crisis; and banks that are financing operations in the territories.

“We will target the ability of the Russian state and government to access our capital and financial market and services,” Mr. Borrell said.

Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the E.U.’s executive branch, called the package “solid.”

Ms. von der Leyen said that the first package of sanctions would limit “the Russian government’s ability to raise capital on the E.U.’s financial markets,” although neither she nor Mr. Borrell immediately explained how that would happen.

Both top E.U. officials hailed the German decision to freeze its Nord Stream 2 pipeline project as a key part of Europe’s response to Russia. “I think the German government is absolutely right,” Ms. von der Leyen, herself a German politician, said.

“Nord Stream 2 has to be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for the whole European Union, because this crisis shows that Europe is still too dependent on Russian gas,” she added.

Mr. Borrell and Ms. von der Leyen said that sanctions would intensify should Russia escalate further.

WASHINGTON — Senators from both parties began working on Tuesday on a multipronged legislative response toward Russian aggression that would provide emergency funds for Ukraine’s defense, sanction Russia’s economy and create a task force to find ways to seize the wealth of Russian oligarchs, and possibly the riches of Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told local reporters in his state that an emergency spending bill and bipartisan sanctions legislation — long delayed in Congress — could pass when lawmakers return from a Presidents’ Day recess.

“I want a sanctions regime from hell next week,” Mr. Graham said. He also had a warning for the broader Russian public: “You can expect bad things to come your way.”

Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said talks began Monday night and were gathering momentum on Tuesday, after senators argued fruitlessly for the past month over the size, shape and timing of a measure to impose sanctions legislatively.

The spending bill would intensify lethal aid to Ukraine and help the Defense Department fund troop deployments to NATO countries to the north and west of Ukraine. The sanctions bill will focus on the superrich oligarchs who have bolstered Mr. Putin.

“There is consensus among Democrats and Republicans that one of the soft underbellies of Putin’s world is the lavish lifestyles of the oligarchs that he supports to keep him in power,” Mr. Graham said.

Mr. Blumenthal said Germany’s action Monday to halt work on a major natural gas pipeline from Russia to Western Europe had removed the biggest sticking point to a sanctions bill. Some Republicans had been pressing hard for sanctions to cripple the NordStream 2 pipeline, but the Biden administration strongly opposed such an action until a Russian attack, fearing that it would splinter the trans-Atlantic alliance and undermine NATO unity.

The toll of conflict: the funeral of a soldier killed in eastern Ukraine.

As the world braces nervously to see how events unfold in Ukraine, the conflict has already been taking a toll. A funeral was held in Kyiv on Tuesday for Capt. Anton Sidorov, a 35-year-old Ukrainian intelligence officer killed three days earlier while serving on the frontline in eastern Ukraine. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia have been simmering since 2014, when the Russian military crossed into Ukrainian territory, annexing Crimea and fomenting a rebellion in the east.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey cut short a three-day Africa trip and is heading back home to attend a virtual NATO summit on Wednesday, his office said. Turkey, a NATO member and ally of the United States, has been trying to walk a fine line between backing Ukraine and disrupting a complicated relationship with Russia. He told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call Tuesday that Russia’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk is “unacceptable,” his office said.

MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia demanded Ukraine recognize Russia’s claim to Crimea and relinquish its advanced weapons, declaring what sounded like an ultimatum minutes after Russian state television showed Parliament authorizing the use of military force abroad.

The cascade of developments in Moscow on Tuesday evening offered the clearest signs yet that Mr. Putin was moving toward mounting a military operation against Ukraine. The goals of such an operation remained uncertain. But in setting out his demands on Tuesday, Mr. Putin made it clear that he was seeking to force a drastic political shift in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, as well as to win control of a large area of the country’s east.

Mr. Putin added that he had not decided to send troops into Ukraine “right at this moment.” But asked whether one could resolve issues by force and “remain on the side of the good,” Mr. Putin made it clear he saw military action as a morally defensible course.

“Why do you think that the good must always be powerless?” Mr. Putin said. “I don’t believe so. I think that the good implies the ability to protect oneself. We will proceed based on this.”

Mr. Putin further laid the foundation for military conflict by declaring that Russia would recognize the sovereignty of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics over the full territory that they claim. That includes a large area of eastern Ukraine that is currently controlled by the Ukrainian government, and includes several cities like Mariupol and Kramatorsk.

“We expect — and I want to emphasize this — that all contentious issues will be resolved in negotiations between today’s Kyiv authorities and the leadership of these republics,” Mr. Putin said. “Unfortunately, at this point in time, we understand that this is impossible because the hostilities there are still ongoing and, moreover, are tending to escalate.”

Mr. Putin signed decrees on Monday recognizing the separatist republics. But until Mr. Putin’s remarks Tuesday evening, it was not clear over what territory he would recognize their sovereignty.

Kyiv has refused to recognize or negotiate directly with the separatist authorities, characterizing them as Kremlin puppets.

In his news conference, Mr. Putin laid out a series of additional demands to Kyiv that, he said, the government must fulfill to resolve the situation “in a long-term, historical perspective.” He said Ukraine must recognize the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, as Russian territory; declare that it will never join the NATO alliance and maintain “neutrality”; and give up all the weaponry that the United States and other Western countries have delivered to it in recent years.

“The most important point is a known degree of demilitarization of Ukraine today,” Mr. Putin said. “This is the only objectively controllable factor that can be observed and reacted to.”

Just before state television aired Mr. Putin’s news conference, it showed Russia’s upper house of Parliament approving a request from Mr. Putin to use military force abroad that had been made public only minutes earlier. A deputy defense minister, Nikolai Pankov, told the assembly that Ukraine had gathered 60,000 troops to attack the Russia-backed separatist enclaves in the country’s east — a step that Ukraine denies having any plans to take.

“Negotiations have reached a dead end,” Mr. Pankov said in a televised speech. “The Ukrainian leadership has taken the path of violence and bloodshed.”

Just after showing the vote, state television cut to the Kremlin, where Mr. Putin was shown holding an unscheduled news conference. He repeated his past, unfounded claims that Ukraine was carrying out a “genocide” of Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. Asked about the potential use of force, Mr. Putin responded, “I didn’t say that the troops will go there right at this moment.”

Two European officials have said that Russia has already sent troops into the area, but Russia has denied having done so.

Mr. Putin signed a decree on Monday ordering Russia’s military to perform “peacekeeping functions” in the separatist territories, the same day that he recognized them as independent nations. But as of Monday evening in Moscow, the Russian Defense Ministry had not said it was deploying troops to the territories.

Valentina Matviyenko, the chairwoman of the upper house house of Parliament, said the use of military force was being approved to “stop this bloody civil war,” according to the Interfax news agency.

President Biden’s remarks on Ukraine will be an hour earlier than previously announced, the White House said, coming at 1 p.m. Eastern. The reason for the change was not immediately clear, but American allies in Europe have already announced sanctions, putting pressure on the United States to deliver a similar announcement sooner.

In the last three and a half months, as U.S. officials watched President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia mount what appeared to be preparations to invade Ukraine, President Biden made three critical decisions about how to handle Russia’s provocations, according to interviews with more than a dozen senior administration officials and others who requested anonymity to discuss confidential meetings.

First, the president approved early on a recommendation to share intelligence far more broadly with allies than was typical, officials said. The idea was to avoid disagreements about tough economic sanctions by ensuring that everyone knew what the United States knew about Mr. Putin’s actions.

Second, Mr. Biden gave the green light for an unprecedented public information campaign against Mr. Putin. With the support of his top intelligence officials — and with a promise to protect the intelligence agencies’ “sources and methods” — the president allowed a wave of public releases aimed at preventing Mr. Putin from employing his usual denials to divide his adversaries.

Third, when it became clear this year that Mr. Putin was continuing to build up forces at Ukraine’s border, the president approved sending Ukraine more weapons, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, and deploying more troops to other countries in Eastern Europe as a show of solidarity with Ukraine and to reassure nervous allies on NATO’s eastern flank.

Listen to ‘The Daily’: Russian Troops Advance
President Vladimir Putin has ordered soldiers into two regions in eastern Ukraine. What comes next?

sabrina tavernise

    From The New York Times, I’m Sabrina Tavernise. This is The Daily.

    On Monday night, Russian troops crossed into two key regions in eastern Ukraine, controlled by forces friendly to Russia in a possible precursor to a wider war.
lynsey addario

    This is Lynsey Addario in the village of Nova Luhansk. We’re being shelled right —

    we’re lying face down.
sabrina tavernise

    The day before, I landed in Kyiv, the country’s capital, and joined my colleagues who’ve been reporting from the ground.

speaker

    A train is expected to depart full with refugees fleeing what —

sabrina tavernise

    They’ve been in the east sending dispatches about rising tensions there.

speaker

    It does feel like from the Russian side a kind of case for going to war is being established, even though the public at large here, I think, is really just not prepared for this kind of war.

sabrina tavernise

    Today: I spoke to one of those colleagues, Valerie Hopkins, about what led to this moment and what’s coming next.

    It’s Tuesday, February 22.

    Valerie, so I arrived in Kyiv on Sunday. And it’s turned out to be a very significant weekend in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Walk me through where this most recent escalation began. Where did it start?
valerie hopkins

    So it all starts in this region of Eastern Ukraine called Donbass, where pro-Moscow forces have been in charge since March 2014. They violently took control of the government and set about trying to create their own statelet.
sabrina tavernise

    I remember that fighting really well. Because I covered that war pretty extensively in 2014. And it was really violent at first. But then it just settled into this slow, grinding rhythm.
valerie hopkins

    Well, exactly. After that, the fighters on both sides dug into their positions. Sometimes they lobbed mortars back and forth. People did die. But it was really slow burning. But starting on Thursday, it started to feel different.

    Thursday morning, we started to see reports that there was intensified shelling on the front line. And the shelling hit a kindergarten and a civilian school and actually injured some ordinary people. And by the time my colleague got there, it became clear that that wasn’t the only place being shelled, that there was actually shelling all across the front line. So by Thursday evening, it became clear that this was a serious escalation.

    And the shelling only intensified on Friday. Artillery shells were hitting civilian targets. My colleague, Andrew Kramer, was on the front line interviewing civilians who said they had been hiding in basements, hiding their babies and very scared of an escalation. And at the same time, the U.S. increased their estimate of Russian troops, putting it at 190,000 Russian troops in and around Ukraine’s borders.

    And then there was a series of events that dramatically raised the stakes.

valerie hopkins

    I am in the Kyiv neighborhood of Podil. I was on my way to go and check out some of the 4,000 plus areas for shelter, like bomb shelters, when there was just an explosion announced in Donetsk. So I canceled my plans. I’m on my way back to see if I can figure out what’s going on.

    Right now, it looks like it was just a car bomb. But the Russian media is playing it big —

valerie hopkins

    Reports that began to emerge that a car bomb had gone off in the center of Donetsk, this self-proclaimed capital of the secessionist republic. And there were reports that this was the car belonging to the chief of the security services there. Rumors immediately began to spread on social media channels that were loyal to these Moscow-backed leaders, saying that this was evidence of a Ukrainian attempt to escalate tensions and invade.

    In the other Republic, the Luhansk People’s Republic, there were reports that a gas pipeline had exploded, which would be very damaging. And within hours, both leaders announced that all of the civilians, all of the women and children living in these two republics, needed to be evacuated immediately, urgently to Russia.
sabrina tavernise

    Wow, so those are three things — bam, bam, bam — right in a row.
valerie hopkins

    Yes. And everything was happening so fast. As my colleagues and I were trying to confirm the car bombing, shortly thereafter, there was news of this pipeline explosion. We can’t get into these separatist republics. Because they have a very strict vetting process for journalists. And they do not want us poking around there to see what was happening.

    But we were already looking out for signs of what is called a “false-flag operation.” The White House and the State Department have been warning for weeks, if not months, that part of any buildup to a further Russian invasion of Ukraine would involve a false flag attack, which is something that would be designed by Russia, but engineered to look like it had been perpetrated by Ukraine.

    And when we started looking into these incidents, it turned out that this car did not actually belong to the security chief. And this video that was circulating widely of the gas explosion was actually something from a totally separate incident that happened in July.
sabrina tavernise

    Oh wow, so months before.
valerie hopkins

    Yeah, but the people were being evacuated nonetheless. And you know, I’ve been in Moscow watching all of the news for the last few months. And the state-owned channels have been preparing the Russian people for a possible war by showing images of suffering citizens in these two separatist republics. They’ve been talking about — even using the word genocide against what Putin estimates to be four million people living in these two territories, and anything that would allow them to show that there was this suffering of their people and a humanitarian crisis that they need to step in and protect.

    And that’s exactly what we could see from the images that started to emerge on Friday night of civilians, women and children trickling over the border in buses, being put up in hastily improvised tent camps, sleeping all together hundreds of people on cots. The images are quite alarming. But the problem is that the Ukrainian government has repeatedly denied any plan to attack this territory, any plan to further inflame tensions.

    And while we’re frantically trying to confirm these reports —

archived recording (joe biden)

    Today, I made two vital calls.

valerie hopkins

    — President Joe Biden addresses the American people.

archived recording (joe biden)

    We have reason to believe the Russian forces are planning to and intend to attack Ukraine in the coming week, the coming days. We believe that they will target Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people. We’re calling out Russia’s plans loudly and repeatedly, not because we want a conflict, but because we’re doing everything in our power to remove any reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine and prevent them from moving.
reporter

    Mr. President, to be clear, you are convinced —

valerie hopkins

    I’ve just watched Joe Biden say that he believes that Putin has made a decision to invade and that that includes attacking Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million people. And I’m — I don’t know what to say. I think a lot of people in Kyiv and in the rest of the country will not really be sleeping well tonight.

    [MUSIC]
sabrina tavernise

    So what happens next?
valerie hopkins

    So on Saturday morning, I woke up after not a lot of sleep following Biden’s comments and got on a Ukrainian military plane to go to the east and see the front line for myself. And we flew to the east. And then we got into a military convoy heading to the region of Svitlodarsk, which is one of the last towns along the front line separating sort of Ukrainian held territory from no man’s land held by the separatists.

    And we were accompanying a delegation of Ukrainian ministers and parliamentarians who were also visiting the front line in a show of solidarity and as part of a fact-finding mission. And I was with a group that was led by a party leader from President Zelensky’s party who had, like President Zelensky, really been tamping down any kind of comments, especially American comments, that a war was imminent, that Putin had made up his mind to invade.

speaker 1

    My family stays in Ukraine. Everybody’s in Ukraine. We live normal lives. We have no extra security measures and so on.
interviewer 1

    Six kids?
speaker 1

    Six kids, right.
interviewer 1

    In Kyiv?
speaker 1

    In Kyiv.
interviewer 1

    And you’re not moving?
speaker 1

    Not moving.
interviewer 2

    You were yourself a refugee.

valerie hopkins

    So with him and a small group of other international journalists —

speaker

    We will divide in two groups. One is in Svitlodarsk.

valerie hopkins

    — we went to a tiny military outpost that was in the village of Nova Luhansk that had been shelled that morning. And actually, one of the mortars that had come over from the separatist fire had injured one soldier whose arm would have to be amputated. And I interviewed the commander of this local post, which before the war was just a place where they repaired old tractors.

    And he basically said, this has been happening. This is going to continue to happen. We are not returning fire. We are just going to endure it. Because we cannot afford any kind of pretext or any kind of messaging that we’re involved in this. And also, we don’t want to damage the civilians on the other side. The Ukrainian government still hopes and maintains an aspiration that they will reincorporate this territory, the separatist-held territory, back into Ukraine. It’s about 7% of the country.

    So they showed us these holes in the ground where the mortars had fallen. And we had a short conversation. And then they told us it was time to go.

speaker

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

    And there was this intense rush. It wasn’t clear to me what was really going on. But they said, you need to get out of here right now.

speaker

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

    So we jumped into the car that was being driven by this 28-year-old soldier, Deniz. And he just floored it.

    And almost immediately, on the place where we had just been standing 10 seconds before, we could hear an explosion.

[explosion]

[scream]

speaker 1

    No, go, go. [EXPLETIVE], dude.
speaker 2

    What’s going on with all of you? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

    And then another one.

[explosion]

speaker

    Yeah, there’s shelling over there.

valerie hopkins

    And then another one.

valerie hopkins

    That’s the fourth one since we arrived.

valerie hopkins

    And Deniz was just saying, just be calm. It’s going to be OK. Be calm. And he was just driving as fast as he could over these potholed roads to get us out of there as more and more shells started going off.

[explosion]

    And then we got back into the town. And we went straight into a Ukrainian military facility, where we had to seek cover as more shells rained down.

valerie hopkins

    The shelling has just continued to intensify. It’s not stopping. I think I’ve counted eight since we drove away so far.

valerie hopkins

    And it later emerged that my group was not the only group that had to run and hide from this fire. Another group of journalists accompanying the defense minister also had to seek cover when they came under fire. And all of this is happening as the world is watching Ukraine and also watching Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, leave the country the day after President Biden said Russia was poised to attack, and go to the Munich Security Conference, where he delivered a speech, where he basically said, Ukraine wants peace. Europe wants peace. The world says it doesn’t want to fight. And Russia says it doesn’t want to attack.

    Someone is lying.

    [MUSIC]
sabrina tavernise

    We’ll be right back.

    So Valerie, what happened after that day of intense shelling?
valerie hopkins

    Well, on Sunday, there was another ominous sign.

archived recording

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

    The Belarusian Ministry of Defense announced that due to the unrest in eastern Ukraine, military exercises that have been going on — joint military exercises, in Belarus with Russian troops, which were scheduled to end on Sunday — would be extended indefinitely. And this for all of us who were watching caused great alarm. Everyone had been looking at Sunday as the day that could prove decisive. Because we had repeatedly heard from Russians, and also from the Belarusian leader, that once the exercises were over, the troops would go home. And this was an ominous announcement with no end date that the troops are going to stay there.

    I mean, it’s Russia’s biggest international deployment of troops since the end of the Cold War.
sabrina tavernise

    Hmm.
valerie hopkins

    Ukraine has a very long border with Belarus. And not only that, but some of the exercises were very close to Belarus’s border with Ukraine. And that’s only about 150 kilometers away from the capital of Kyiv.
sabrina tavernise

    OK, so from what you’ve told me, you’re seeing Russian separatists firing shells to the Ukrainian side. And then the Ukrainians you’re talking to are saying they’re not firing back, because they can’t afford to escalate the fight with Russia. Yet Russia’s using the unrest in the East, unrest that appears to be completely driven by Russian separatists, as a reason to keep its troops on the ground in Belarus.
valerie hopkins

    Yes. The Ukrainians are pointing out actually that we haven’t seen any credible evidence of civilians in either of these two separatist-held territories being killed. But reporting by me and my colleagues on the ground has shown that there are soldiers and civilians being shelled and even killed almost every day on the Ukrainian-held side of the territory.

    On Monday, my colleague Andrew Kramer documented one area near the separatist region that had just been hit by 12 mortar shells.

andrew kramer

    I’m in the village of Vrubivka in the aftermath of a mortar or artillery strike earlier today. And the windows in some of the houses around have been blown out. There are branches on the ground. People are sweeping up glass.

valerie hopkins

    He visited a woman.

woman

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

    And when he spoke to her, she was so anxious. She was totally shook up. You know, and she showed him a video that she made while the shelling was going on.

woman

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

    You can see how scared she is.

woman

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[explosion]

valerie hopkins

    At a certain point, she falls down.

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

    At another point —

    — the whole video just goes black. And you can hear her calling out for her mom. And she says —

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

    — I’m sure they’ve hit. They’ve hit us. They’ve hit my house.

    [MUSIC]

    And then —

    [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

valerie hopkins

    — later in the day, Putin delivered a fiery, hour-long speech about Ukraine.

archived recording (vladimir putin)

    [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

valerie hopkins

    You know, he’s expressing all of his grievances against Ukraine.

archived recording (vladimir putin)

    [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

valerie hopkins

    He’s expressing why he basically thinks that Ukraine doesn’t really deserve to exist as an independent state.

archived recording (vladimir putin)

    [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

valerie hopkins

    He’s saying it’s a creation of Soviet leaders. And, you know, he starts trying to lay out an argument for why Ukraine is actually not a great place to live and why throwing your lot in with the West is not what Ukraine should be doing.

archived recording (vladimir putin)

    [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

valerie hopkins

    And near the end, he pointed to these eastern regions, where there’s been so much unrest and where thousands of people have been evacuated in the last five days. He accused the government in Kyiv of not honoring these people’s wish to speak Russian in their native language. And he essentially said —

archived recording (vladimir putin)

    [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

valerie hopkins

    — that the government in Kyiv was committing a genocide against these four million people while the West turned away and pretended that it didn’t know about it. And that was why he said —

archived recording (vladimir putin)

    [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

valerie hopkins

    — he would honor the request of the two separatist leaders to recognize them as independent republics and signed a decree with both of them present, recognizing them.

archived recording (vladimir putin)

    [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

sabrina tavernise

    And what did you make of that?
valerie hopkins

    Well, we were all wondering what it could mean. And we got a partial answer less than an hour later, when the Kremlin announced it had ordered Russia’s defense ministry to deploy what they were calling peacekeepers into the two republics whose independence Putin had just recognized.

    [MUSIC]
sabrina tavernise

    So if there was any question about what the last four days were building toward, it sure seems like now at 1:39 a.m. in Kyiv, that they were building toward what looks like an invasion.
valerie hopkins

    Absolutely. As we speak, Russian soldiers are rolling in to what constitutes 7% of Ukraine’s territory. And we don’t really know what they’re going to do next. We don’t know if they’re going to stay there. We don’t know if this is the beginning of a long-feared, full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.

    But if this escalates, and if this results in a full invasion, it’s going to be the largest military action in Europe since World War II. And we don’t know where this is going to stop. But in Putin’s speech, he made it clear that this is about more than just these territories in the East.

archived recording (vladimir putin)

    [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

valerie hopkins

    He said that if the Ukrainian side did not de-escalate, the complete responsibility for the possibility of a continuation of bloodshed would be fully and wholly on the conscience of the regime ruling the territory of Ukraine. And that sitting here in Kyiv has sent shivers down my spine and I think down the spines of many of the people watching that.

    On Monday night, the United States said it would impose economic sanctions on the two regions of Ukraine that Russia has now recognized as independent. But the U.S. stopped short of imposing sanctions directly on Russia, saying it would reserve those penalties for if or when Russia pushes further into Ukraine.

    We’ll be right back.

    Here’s what else you need to know today.

    So let us learn to live with this virus and continue protecting ourselves and others without restricting our freedoms. And in that spirit, Mr. Speaker, I commend this statement to the house.

sabrina tavernise

    On Monday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ending all of the country’s remaining Covid restrictions and entrusting British citizens to learn to live with the virus.

archived recording (boris johnson)

    And Mr. Speaker, it is time that we got our confidence back. We don’t need laws to compel people to be considerate to others. We can rely on that sense of responsibility towards one another.

sabrina tavernise

    The announcement puts Britain well ahead of most European countries in seeking a return to normalcy. And it came as the country’s 96-year-old queen disclosed that she had been infected with Covid. So far, according to Buckingham Palace, the queen’s symptoms are mild.

    And the top court in Colombia has ruled that abortion is no longer a crime, a decision that paves the way for the procedure to become widely available across the country. The ruling follows a similar court decision in Mexico, which, like Colombia, is a historically conservative and Catholic country, where abortion had long been outlawed.

President Biden will be delivering a speech on the situation in Ukraine at 2 p.m. this afternoon, the White House just announced. He is expected to impose severe sanctions on Russia for its actions yesterday, but it remains unclear how much economic punishment will be held back as a deterrent to further aggression by Vladimir Putin, the Russian president.

Republicans and Democrats are pressing Biden to swiftly impose crippling sanctions on Moscow.

After failing to act themselves , some senators are demanding fast and severe action by President Biden to punish Russian aggression in Ukraine.

Calls for crippling sanctions are gaining steam in some quarters of Congress, but so are political aspersions. Perhaps most telling is the silence from Republican and Democratic leaders, who are divided on the politics of action and split by divisions within their respective caucuses.

The demands by some rank-and-file lawmakers for action are growing more strident.

“The time for taking action to impose significant costs on President Putin and the Kremlin starts now,” declared Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a key ally of the president’s.

Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said security assistance to Ukraine must ramp up now and demanded “strong and immediate sanctions.”

“If this administration wishes to have a strong and decisive reaction that will deter even more aggressive behavior, they should follow our lead — the world is watching, and decisive action is needed,” Mr. Risch said in a statement.

Just what “lead” Mr. Risch was referring to was unclear. A month of back-room efforts to unite around tough sanctions legislation came to nothing before the Senate left Washington last week for a Presidents’ Day recess.

The Senate’s caution was typified by the statement released by the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who said on Monday evening: “To be clear, if any additional Russian troops or proxy forces cross into Donbas, the Biden administration and our European allies must not hesitate in imposing crushing sanctions. There must be tangible, far-reaching and substantial costs for Russia in response to this unjustified act.”

The Democrat did not explain what he meant by “additional Russian troops.” Troops were flowing in at the time of his statement.

Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, alluded on Tuesday to the collapse of Congress’s efforts to reach consensus on sanctions, suggesting that lawmakers had missed an opportunity to change Mr. Putin’s behavior.

And other Republicans said Mr. Biden was to blame.

“Joe Biden has refused to take meaningful action, and his weakness has emboldened Moscow,” Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said in a statement on Tuesday, echoing Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who wrote on Monday, “Biden-Harris officials are to an enormous extent directly responsible for this crisis.”

More striking is the relative silence from congressional leaders. Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said in recent days that Mr. Biden had the authority he needed to act, and expressed support for his diplomacy.

After meeting on Monday with Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, Ms. Pelosi issued a statement calling Mr. Putin’s move “a thinly veiled attempt to mask what is a clear attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

“We commend President Biden for his strong leadership and Prime Minister Johnson for his partnership,” she said.

The British government says that, in line with other Western countries, it will sanction members of the Russian Parliament who voted to recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk. It will also create legislation to ensure that no British individual or company can do business with Donetsk and Luhansk.

The Biden administration said it is still debating on Tuesday morning what package of sanctions to unleash against Vladimir V. Putin, his friends and Russia’s financial system. But all the early indications suggested that officials planned to leave some in reserve in hopes of preventing a far larger attack on Ukraine that could cause tens of thousands of casualties.

Early Tuesday morning, Jon Finer, Mr. Biden’s deputy national security adviser, said that Russia’s forces had begun to move into Ukraine, declaring on CNN that “an invasion is an invasion, and that is what is underway.”

The choice of the word “invasion” was significant. That was the trigger for sanctions, and Mr. Biden angered the Ukrainian leadership when he suggested in a news conference that there might be lesser penalties for a “minor incursion.” Now that Mr. Putin has ordered forces into Eastern Ukraine, the administration, in its choice of words, is making clear that there is nothing minor about the operation.

But that still leaves open the question of how to calibrate the sanctions — because so far there have been no mass casualties. Mr. Finer quickly indicated that the administration could hold back some of its promised punishments in the hopes of deterring further, far more violent aggression by Mr. Putin aimed at taking the rest of the country.

“We’ve always envisioned waves of sanctions that would unfold over time in response to steps Russia actually takes not just statements that they make,” Mr. Finer said. “We’ve always said we’re going to watch the situation on the ground and have a swift and severe response.”

Overnight, Mr. Biden and his aides were consulting with allies, so that their response would be coordinated. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson pointed toward the direction they were leaning when he told Parliament on Tuesday that “this is the first tranche, the first barrage of what we are prepared to do and we hold further sanctions at readiness to be deployed along side the United States and European Union if the situation escalates still further.”

It is one of those situations where Mr. Biden has no truly good choices. If his response seems too mild, he will send the message to Mr. Putin that the world is not going to make him pay a big price for sending troops into the Russian-speaking eastern part of the country — replicating what happened when the Russian leader annexed Crimea in 2014. If he implements all of the sanctions, Mr. Putin may conclude that there is nothing left to keep him from attacking the rest of the country.

Mr. Biden discussed this dilemma at a news conference in January. He said that if an attack was “something significantly short of a significant invasion” he would impose sanctions, but only to the point that European allies go along. And several of those allies have more at stake, including their gas supplies. “I got to make sure everybody is on the same page as we move along,’’ Mr. Biden said.

That was the news conference where he used the phrase “minor incursions,” and then had to backtrack, promising sanctions if one Russian soldier goes into Ukraine. But his words were revealing about how he thinks about the problem. If “there’s Russian forces crossing the border, killing Ukrainian fighter, et cetera — I think that changes everything.”

Mr. Biden also said during that news conference that “the most important thing to do: Big nations can’t bluff,” a phrase that now leaves him open to criticism after saying for weeks that even one soldier crossing the border into Ukraine would trigger an entire barrage of sanctions against Russia.

Many of the nearly 5,000 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division who arrived in Poland last week are working with Polish forces to set up processing centers for tens of thousands of people, including Americans, who are expected to flee neighboring Ukraine if Russia launches a full-scale invasion of the country, U.S. military officials said.

The Biden administration has repeatedly said U.S. troops will not fight in Ukraine or rescue Americans trapped there by a Russian attack. But U.S. commanders and their counterparts in Poland have been preparing parts of several Polish military facilities and erecting tents for possible evacuees.

So far, American officials said, there have been few, if any, people who have sought to use the facilities. But a nationwide attack on Ukraine could result in one million to five million refugees, with many of them pouring into Poland, Pentagon officials have estimated.

That could lead to the largest flood of refugees in Europe since nearly a million Syrian refugees arrived in 2015, a surge that had a profound impact on European politics by bolstering far-right parties.

President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia recognized the independence of two territories in eastern Ukraine, Luhansk and Donetsk, that are largely controlled by Russia-backed separatists. Shortly afterward, Russian troops were ordered into the area, a move that threatened to sharply escalate the conflict.

The day after Vladimir Putin’s announcement, we are still looking for signals on where things go from here. The Kremlin has hinted that it could recognize all of Ukraine’s Luhansk and Donetsk regions as part of the separatist “people’s republics,” potentially setting up a justification for a Russian offensive against Ukrainian forces. But the Russian Foreign Ministry says it remains open to talks with the West and claims that Russia has not yet deployed troops to the regions — despite the decrees signed by Putin ordering the Russian military to carry out “peacekeeping functions” there.

A pivotal question looms: How much separatist territory will Putin recognize?

MOSCOW — The future of the Ukraine crisis on Tuesday hinged, in part, on a definition.

The Russia-backed separatists whose independence President Vladimir V. Putin recognized on Monday claim three times as much territory as they control. As Russian lawmakers on Tuesday moved to endorse the recognition, Moscow sent mixed messages on what Russia would define as the enclaves’ official boundaries.

The significance of that decision was potentially momentous.

If Russia chooses to recognize only the territory of Ukraine’s Luhansk and Donetsk regions that is currently controlled by the separatists, it could deploy Russian forces into that territory without using force.

But if it decrees that, as the separatists claim, the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics comprise the entirety of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, then the Kremlin could cite that as justification to launch an assault against Ukrainian troops stationed at the front line.

On Tuesday, Andrei Rudenko, a deputy foreign minister, said Russia would recognize the separatist republics on the territory where their leadership “exercises its authority and jurisdiction,” Russian news agencies reported.

But later in the day, the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, provided a different characterization of the territory of the newly recognized statelets: “The boundaries that they proclaimed for themselves when these two republics were proclaimed.”

That seemed to signal that Mr. Putin was defining the “people’s republics” as having rightful sovereignty over all of Ukraine’s Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which include major cities like Mariupol and Kramatorsk that are currently under Ukrainian control. Asked to clarify whether the people’s republics included Mariupol, Mr. Peskov said, according to the Interfax news agency: “I have nothing to add. Those boundaries in which they exist and were declared.”

The ambiguity showed that Mr. Putin — as he has throughout his military buildup surrounding Ukraine — was trying to keep open multiple options for how to act in the coming hours and days.

Dmitri Khoroshilov, the vice speaker of the Luhansk People’s Republic Parliament, previewed what could be a worst-case scenario: a Russian offensive against Ukraine to win control of the entire territory of the two regions.

“We must call on Ukraine to voluntarily withdraw its troops” from all of the Luhansk region, Mr. Khoroshilov said on Tuesday, according to Interfax. “If this does not happen, I believe that a decision will be made that will allow peace to be established and to restore our territorial integrity on the full territory of the Luhansk People’s Republic.”
