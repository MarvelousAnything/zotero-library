a triangle for the George Floyd protests 4. Assignment on Structural Violence

George Floyd video
As you watch, consider the following when thinking about if there is structural violence in the United States:
Were the protests violent or nonviolent? Always? How many different sides were there? Did all sides approach the protests in the same way? That last guy who shows up… what additional method of nonviolence does his organization add that feels pretty critical?

Are these violent or non-violent?

Conflict Dynamics: How does violent conflict happen?
● One side is violent, the other side responds with violence
● Cycle of violence that just leads to more conﬂict and more violence
○ This is an oversimpliﬁcation; conﬂicts dynamics are much more complicated than that
● HOWEVER… it is possible to try and simplify a conﬂict to get a better understanding of the forces that lead to violence

Galtung’s Conflict Triangle Theory
Galtung sought to further understand the underlying causes of violent conﬂict and how the perspectives of conﬂict parties inﬂuence their behaviors.
“The killed are dead, the bereaved are traumatized. The trauma may be converted to hatred that may be converted
into revenge addiction.”
– Johan Galtung

The Triangle: A-B-C
● To illustrate the relationship between the latent causes of violent conflict → views of conflict parties → behaviors of the parties, Galtung made a triangle with three points:
○ Attitudes/assumptions ○ Behavior ○ Contradictions
● Each point can influence, lead to, or cause the other two ● The triangle is also separated into a manifest level and a latent
level
○ Shows how conflict can often be unseen and is only occasionally visible when the parties take action

Attitudes/Assumptions Video: Critical Race Theory

● What critical race theory is
● Why some people believe it is necessary to teach in school
● Why some people resist or oppose the teaching of critical race theory

Optional extension:
What is Critical Race Theory

Instructions: Work with assigned partner/group to read through one of the readings above. Record notes while you read and discuss with your table.
When you are ﬁnished your assigned reading, start creating a conﬂict triangle on the large sheet of provided paper. On the triangle identify examples of:
● attitudes/assumptions (what do the conﬂict parties believe? try to indicate who thinks what) ● behavior (including violence and nonviolence) ● contradictions (where are the inequalities?)
