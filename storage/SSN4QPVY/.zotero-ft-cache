Blinken says Ukraine invasion was Putin's plan 'all along'

US secretary of state Antony Blinken earlier said an invasion of Ukraine had been Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “ plan all along” , calling the situation a “ manufactured crisis ”.

In a joint press conference with Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in Washington held on Tuesday evening local time, Blinken said:

    His plan all along has been to invade Ukraine; to control Ukraine and its people; to destroy Ukraine’s democracy, which offers a stark contrast to the autocracy that he leads; to reclaim Ukraine as a part of Russia .

    That’s why this is the greatest threat to security in Europe since world war two”.

Russia’s ambassador to the United States has hit back at the imposition of sanctions imposed by US president Joe Biden, suggesting the move would hurt global financial and energy markets as well as ordinary citizens.

According to a recent post on the Russian embassy Facebook page early Wednesday, ambassador Anatoly Antonov said:

    Sanctions will not solve anything regarding Russia. It’s hard to imagine that anyone in Washington is counting on Russia to review its foreign policy course under threat of restrictions.

    I don’t remember a single day when our country lived without any restrictions from the Western world. We learned how to work in such conditions. And not only survive, but also develop our state.

    There is no doubt that the sanctions imposed against us will hurt the global financial and energy markets.

    The United States will not be left out, where ordinary citizens will feel the full consequences of rising prices.”

National defence minister Anita Anand said:

    Today, our Canadian Armed Forces made a second delivery of lethal military aid to support our Ukrainian partners.

    Russia’s further invasion of a sovereign state is absolutely unacceptable, and we will continue to stand by Ukraine as the country defends its sovereignty and independence.”

Australia has confirmed it will hit Russia with a range of sanctions targeting transport energy, telecommunications, oil, gas and mineral reserves.

Sanctions and travel bans will also target eight members of the Russian Federation’s security council, while existing sanctions in place over past Russian aggression will be expanded, prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Wednesday. Russian banks have also been targeted.

Morrison said he expects further tranches of sanctions that will target more individuals after convening cabinet’s national security committee earlier in the day.

Morrison told reporters from Canberra:

    The invasion of Ukraine has effectively already begun.

    Australians always stand up to bullies and we will be standing up to Russia along with all of our partners, and all those who believe that it is totally unacceptable that Russia could invade its neighbour.

Morrison said the government will “immediately” begin placing sanctions on Russian individuals and will amend the Autonomous Sanctions regulation of 2011 to extend existing sanctions that apply to Crimea and Sevastopol to the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Oil prices dipped at the start of Wednesday’s trading session as the market judged that sanctions against Russia will not do much to disrupt supplies from the world’s third largest producer.

Crude prices have surged in recent weeks to a seven-year high on alarm about the conflict in Ukraine possibly interrupting supplies from Russia, which accounts for about 11% of global supply .

But Brent crude fell 13 cents, or 0.1%, to $96.71 a barrel at 0142 GMT, after soaring as high as $99.50 on Tuesday, the highest since September 2014 as it became clear the first wave of US and European sanctions on Russia for sending troops into eastern Ukraine would not disrupt oil supply.

A potential return of more Iranian crude to the market, with Tehran and world powers close to reviving a nuclear agreement, also helped to push prices down.

Asian stock markets were back in positive territory on Wednesday despite more losses on Wall Street on Tuesday.

While we are in the Asia Pacifc region, Australia’ s prime minister Scott Morrison is set to convene a cabinet national security committee as western nations begin to impose sanctions against Russia .

The committee is expected to finalise what targeted sanctions and measures Australia will introduce .

International security and intelligence professor John Blaxland said Australia would look to support European and Nato action “without overstepping the mark”.

“I’m a little bit worried that this may once again become a political football and we need to be very, very cautious at this point,” he told the Nine Network.

Australia has ruled out direct military assistance and is supporting Ukraine’s cyber-capability. It has left the door open for technical military support but the prime minister declined to elaborate on what the term meant.

Home affairs minister Karen Andrews told radio 4BC: “We’ll be considering sanctions and the extent of those and in the days to follow.”

Taiwan ’s security and armed forces must increase their surveillance and alertness on military activities in the region, president Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday during a meeting to discuss the Ukraine crisis, Reuters reports.

Taiwan and Ukraine are fundamentally different in terms of geostrategic, geographical environment and importance of international supply chains, but government units must tackle possible “cognitive warfare” and misinformation by foreign forces, Tsai’s office cited her as saying.

The future of the world order is 'being decided in Ukraine' Kuleba says

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrapped up his interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper this evening by providing a list of reasons as to why the United States should be invested in the conflict in Ukraine.

    First, in 1994 Ukraine abandoned its nuclear arsenal which was the third in size in the world ... We abandoned it in return for security guarantees issued in particular by the United States. We were promised that if anyone attacks us, the United States would be among countries who will be helping us.

    Second, what is happening in Ukraine is not only about Ukraine. President Putin challenges Euro-Atlantic order. If the West fails in Ukraine, the next target of Putin will be one of the Nato members on its eastern flank.

    Third, if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, other players across the globe who want to change rules, who want to bypass the United States, they will see that this is possible, that the West is incapable of defending what it stands for.

    All in all ... Americans should be interested in keeping the world order as it stands and the future of this order is being decided right now in Ukraine.”

Continuing to dissect Kuleba ’s interview with CNN earlier, the foreign minister said that although he supports the recent US sanctions as an “important” message, he believes they are insufficient in dissuading a Russian attack.

    No sanctions will be enough until Russian boots withdraw from Ukrainian soil.

    This is [the] fundamental principle, that we have to keep putting pressure on Russia and we in Ukraine proceed from the fact that the sanctions announced today by President Biden is just the beginning of the process of deterring president Putin and making him withdraw.”

Referring to any further sanctions, Kuleba suggested no single option or possibility should be left off the table.

    We want every instrument available to be used in order to stop Putin.

    If the price of saving a country is the most, harshest sanctions possible, then we should go for the harshest sanctions possible.”

Putin’s ultimate goal is to 'destroy Ukraine', foreign minister says

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba says Russian president Vladimir Putin’s ultimate goal is to “destroy Ukraine” and “no sanctions will be enough” until Russian forces withdraw from Ukrainian soil.

During an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Kubela said:

    His ultimate goal is to destroy Ukraine. He’s not interested in parts of Ukraine . He is not interested in even keeping the entire country under his control.

    What I know for certain, and this was eloquently proved, regretfully, in his address yesterday, is that he hates [the] Ukrainian statehood, he believes that Ukraine has no right to exist.

Putin “wants the idea of the Ukrainian statehood to fail. This is his objective,” Kubela added.

Former US president Donald Trump has called Russian president Vladimir Putin a “genius” for his decision to recognise the two self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk of Ukraine and deploy troops into the Russian-controlled territory.

In an interview with American conservative talk radio hosts on the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Trump said:

    This is genius Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine — of Ukraine . Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful.

    So, Putin is now saying, ‘It’s independent,’ a large section of Ukraine. I said, ‘How smart is that?’ ...

    Here’s a guy who’s very savvy… I know him very well. Very, very well.”

Trump accused Joe Biden of being “weak” in his response to Putin, adding that it “never would have happened” if he were still president.

    By the way, this never would have happened with us. Had I been in office, not even thinkable. This would never have happened.”

Referring to Putin, Trump added:

    I think he sees this opportunity. I knew that he always wanted Ukraine. I used to talk to him about it. I said, ‘You can’t do it. You’re not gonna do it.’ But I could see that he wanted it. I used to ask him. We used to talk about it at length.”
