A humanitarian crisis in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol deepened Thursday as the mayor likened Russia’s attack to “Armageddon” and said the Kremlin’s troops are firing on residential areas, thwarting evacuations.

“Every 30 minutes, the city of Mariupol was visited by aviation which worked in residential areas, killing civilians: old people, women, children,” said the mayor, Vadym Boichenko, a day after a strike tore through a maternity hospital, killing at least three people and injuring 17. Video footage verified by The Washington Post shows residents circling a massive crater they say was left by an explosion. Bodies have piled up on streets .

Boichenko said in a video that humanitarian supplies were unable to enter Mariupol for a sixth day Thursday, as a Russian blockade leaves the seaside hub without much water, electricity or heat and impedes communication.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said not one person has been evacuated from Mariupol, even as escape routes open for civilians in other major cities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said evacuations moved more than 60,000 people nationwide Wednesday.

Here’s what to know

    Companies continued to pull away from Russia on Thursday. The Walt Disney Co. said it will pause all business there , while Burger King said it is suspending corporate support for hundreds of franchises and Google restricted its cloud services.
    Vice President Harris said Thursday that the U.S. relationship with Poland and the NATO alliance remains strong and united against Russia , even after disagreement over fighter jets that the U.S. warned could draw the Western alliance further into war.
    The U.S. intelligence community says Ukraine is not manufacturing biological weapons, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers, countering Russian claims that the country operates bioweapons laboratories within its borders.
    Russian President Vladimir Putin endorsed a plan Thursday to nationalize foreign-owned businesses that flee the country over its invasion of Ukraine, reflecting the Kremlin’s alarm over job losses and other economic pain the exodus is inflicting.

Facebook to allow for some calls for violence against Russia

Facebook will allow some calls for violence against Russian invaders, creating an unusual exception to its long-standing hate speech rules that prohibit such language.

“As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders.’ We still won’t allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,” said spokesman Andy Stone.

Facebook and other Silicon Valley companies have faced immense pressure to isolate and crack down on Russia as the war enters its third week. Facebook, TikTok and YouTube banned Russian state media in Europe and in Ukraine in response to government requests, limiting Russia’s ability to spread propaganda and misinformation to millions of people. But the Ukrainian government has pressed the companies to go further — asking them to fully shut down their services in Russia as punishment for the invasion.

Harris and Polish president seek to move beyond disagreement over jets

WARSAW — Vice President Harris and Polish President Andrzej Duda sought Thursday to downplay a disagreement between their countries over providing fighter jets for Ukraine, emphasizing instead America’s commitment to defend NATO and to help a flood of Ukrainian refugees .

Harris’s meeting with Duda, like a session with Romanian leaders set for Friday, was an effort to reassure NATO countries increasingly anxious about Russian aggression. But its early moments were overshadowed by a surprise statement by Poland earlier in the week that it wanted to transfer an unspecified number of MiG-29 jets to the United States, which could launch them from Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

The United States rejected that offer , worried that the prospect of jets taking off from a NATO country to battle it out with Russian planes in the skies over Ukraine could turn a war between two countries into a broader, even global, conflict.

Asked about the fighter planes on Thursday, Harris stressed that the tactical disagreement on that issue did not blunt the broad U.S. support for Poland and other NATO member nations.

“I want to be very clear,” Harris told reporters. “The United States and Poland are united in what we have done, and are prepared to do, to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, full stop.”

She added, “The United States’ commitment to Article 5 is ironclad. The United States is prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory.” Under Article 5 of the NATO treaty, the alliance’s members agree to come to one another’s aid in case of attack.

Poland and Romania are NATO members; Ukraine is not.

U.S. ambassador warns of potential torture and mock executions in a Russian occupation of Ukraine

Millions of civilians prevented from fleeing Ukraine by Russia’s “siege warfare” are at risk of violence in a Russian occupation, a U.S. ambassador warned in Vienna on Thursday.

Cities including Mariupol, Kharkiv and Sumy are under bombardment, and their residents prevented from leaving, said Michael Carpenter, U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

Speaking to the organization’s Permanent Council, Carpenter outlined what a potential occupation of Ukraine could look like, based on what Russia has done before.

“Since 2014, there have been scores, if not hundreds, of reports documenting atrocities by Russia and its proxies in Russia-controlled parts of the Donbas and in Crimea,” he said. Donbas is a separatist-held region in eastern Ukraine. Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014, a move Ukraine called illegitimate.

“There are credible reports of enforced disappearances and abductions of dissidents, members of religious and ethnic minority groups, and others who dare to voice dissatisfaction with Russia’s criminal rule,” he said.

In the Donbas, at prisons and unofficial places of detention, Carpenter said, “Russia-led forces routinely beat and physically and psychologically tortured detainees, conducted mock executions, committed sexual violence, deprived detainees of food, water, and medical care, and required forced labor. ”

He added that according to the United Nations, women and men are victims of sexual violence, including rape, threats of castration, intentional damage to genitalia, threats of sexual violence against family members and forced prostitution.

Russia’s proxies in the Donbas and occupation forces in Crimea have also restricted freedom of expression on the street, in the news media and on the Internet, and have blocked international aid groups from delivering food and other assistance to civilians, Carpenter said.

“So, we don’t have to guess what Russia will do if it occupies Ukraine,” he said. “We’ve been watching it play out for eight straight years.”

Mariupol going through ‘Armageddon’ as Russia fires on residential areas, mayor says

The mayor of Mariupol said Thursday that people in his blockaded Ukrainian port city were going through “Armageddon” and “two days of hell” as Russian forces fired on residential areas.

“Every 30 minutes, the city of Mariupol was visited by aviation, which worked in residential areas, killing civilians: old people, women, children,” Mayor Vadym Boichenko said in a video, describing Thursday’s devastation. “This is the greatness of the Russian army.”

Accusing Russia of “genocide” and calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a “terrorist,” Boichenko said 400,000 residents of Mariupol are being held captive, waiting for a “humanitarian corridor” to materialize. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly accused Russia of violating temporary cease-fires meant to clear the way for civilian evacuations and delivery of supplies.

Leaders have also warned for days of a humanitarian crisis in southern Mariupol, saying Russian forces have cut off entrances and exits and left the city without much water, electricity, heat or mobile communication. On Wednesday, at least three people were killed and 17 were injured there in a strike on a maternity hospital .

Speaking in a video the Mariupol City Council posted to Telegram on Thursday, Boichenko said “humanitarian cargo” was unable to enter the city for a sixth day. He said there remained no viable path for evacuation, despite Russian promises.

“As we try to get through, we run into mines, we hit tanks, we fall under the hail,” he said. “A struggle for the life of our city” was underway Thursday, the mayor said, led by Ukraine’s top officials.

“Work is underway to make this corridor, so that the cargo that needs to reach Mariupol could reach it,” Boichenko said. “I am sure it will.”

U.S. considers sending more sophisticated weapons to Ukraine after scuttling Polish fighter-jet deal
Return to menu

U.S. officials are considering sending the Ukrainian military more complex weapons, including air-defense systems that are more sophisticated than the “man-portable” missiles the United States and allies have been sending in large quantities, a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday.

The additional assistance could help bolster Ukrainian forces as Russia increasingly relies on its air force after mostly keeping it grounded early in the invasion. The senior defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, declined to say what kind of additional weapons could be added. One possibility could be the S-300, which launches surface-to-air missiles and is capable of targeting drones and planes. The United States does not possess the Soviet-made S-300, but allies such as Bulgaria do, and Ukrainian forces are familiar with it.

The comments came one day after U.S. officials short-circuited a proposal by Poland to turn over MiG-29 fighter jets to the United States for transfer to Ukraine. The deal would have boosted the size of the Ukrainian air force, with the United States sending F-16s to Poland to fill the gaps in their arsenal. U.S. officials said they saw the deal having significant risks of escalation with Russia, with minimum value, considering the Ukrainian air force largely remains intact.

Russian forces have continued slow advances around several cities.

As of Thursday, the Russians had launched 775 missiles at Ukraine since the invasion began, the senior defense official said. The number continues to climb by a few dozen per day.

Disney pauses business in Russia

The Walt Disney Co. announced Thursday that it will pause all business in Russia, adding to the growing list of companies who are ending or limiting financial ties to the nation.

The pause on all business includes content and product licensing, Disney Cruise Line activities, National Geographic magazine, tours and content production, a company spokesperson said in a statement .

The spokesperson said some of the business activities can be paused immediately while others, such as some content and product licensing, will take longer to stop because of “contractual complexities.”

“Even as we pause these businesses, we remain committed to our dedicated colleagues in Russia, who will remain employed,” the company said. “And we continue to work with our NGO [nongovernmental organization] partners to provide urgent aid and other much-needed assistance to refugees.”

Activists and Ukrainian allies have called for major companies such as Disney to alter or cease their business with Russia in response to the invasion.

Stocks slump, oil prices retreat after Russia-Ukraine talks yield little
Return to menu

Wall Street slumped Thursday, with the major U.S. indexes edging broadly lower as investors remained lasered in on the crisis in Ukraine and its economic ripple effects.

After an emphatic rally Wednesday, stocks turned negative in premarket trading on news that the first high-level round of diplomatic talks between Russia and Ukraine failed to produce any resolution. After opening 1 percent lower, the Dow Jones industrial average finished down 112.18 points, about 0.3 percent, to end regular trading at 33,174.07. The S&P 500 index slid more than 18 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 4,259.52. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell roughly 125 points, almost 1 percent, to settle at 13,129.96.

Markets typically look past geopolitical tensions, but the particular unpredictability of this conflict has riled investors as it drags into a third week. Stocks have been moving in lockstep with headlines because of Russia’s role as a major global oil producer, as disruptions to energy markets and other commodities will exacerbate inflation. And that’s all combining with the storm cloud of uncertainty stemming from the pandemic, including a vexed labor market and a global supply chain in deep distress.

Fresh data Thursday confirmed that in February, before the invasion, prices were up 7.9 percent compared to a year ago, the biggest spike in 40 years.

“The war in Ukraine has changed the inflation conversation,” Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said in commentary Thursday. “Food, energy, the basics of life will keep on getting more expensive and companies experiencing further supply price hikes will find they have little choice but to pass those increases on to their customers.”

Oil prices, which have jumped near $130 a barrel in recent weeks, bounced around Thursday. Brent crude, the international benchmark, shed 1.8 percent to near $109 a barrel after erasing earlier gains. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, fell 2.27 percent to trade near $105.50 per barrel.

Gas prices, meanwhile, continue to surge. The U.S. average for gallon of gas has spiked roughly 60 cents in the past week, hitting $4.31 as of Thursday, according to data from AAA. At the same time last year, the national average was $2.81.

Gold, an investor safe haven, edged up 0.6 percent to trade just above $2,000 per troy ounce.

Interpol rejects calls to suspend Russia, says data-sharing must continue

Interpol on Thursday rejected calls to suspend Russia’s access to the policing consortium’s data on crimes around the world, calling neutrality “fundamental” to its work even when some of its 195 member countries are in conflict.

“As long as the INTERPOL network can assist in the rescue of one child abuse victim, the prevention of one terrorist attack or the identification of one missing person, it is its duty to ensure that lines of communication remain open,” the international group’s leadership said in a statement.

Officials in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand — the members of the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance — had urged Interpol to “decide this week on the immediate suspension of Russia’s access,” according to the U.S. Justice Department. U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel argued that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a “direct threat to the safety of individuals and to international law enforcement cooperation.”

But Interpol’s General Secretariat, the central body that runs the cooperative, said its mandate “does not include issuing sanctions or taking punitive measures.” It said many law enforcement leaders expressed concerns about the consequences of halting information-sharing and said war creates fertile ground for exploitation, trafficking, smuggling and other crimes.

This year, Interpol said, almost 60,000 checks against its databases have referenced data from Russia.

“INTERPOL was created to ensure the widest possible law enforcement cooperation, including between countries where diplomatic relations do not exist,” the General Secretariat said.

The group said its secretary general is working to prevent misuse of Interpol’s channels to target people in Ukraine and beyond. It noted that Ukraine has disconnected from its network. Now all of Moscow’s requests for international cooperation must go through the General Secretariat “to be checked for compliance,” Interpol leadership said.

Sen. Cortez Masto accuses Shell VP of ‘prioritizing payouts to shareholders’ amid Russian invasion, high fuel prices

Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) questioned Shell Oil Vice President Colette Hirstius about “prioritizing payouts to shareholders" in a March 10 hearing. (C-SPAN)

As gas prices continue to hit record highs in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, American lawmakers are questioning what oil companies are doing now that the Biden administration has banned all imports of oil and natural gas from Russia.

So when a Shell executive appeared at a Thursday hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) asked why major oil companies nationwide have recently acknowledged that they would prefer to use the earnings from higher gas prices to give more lucrative payouts to shareholders rather than look to drill new or existing wells.

“Can you explain at a time like this why your company would be prioritizing payouts to shareholders rather than working to increase our oil supply?” the senator asked.

Colette Hirstius, senior vice president at Shell Gulf of Mexico, a Shell subsidiary, responded by saying the company believed it was important to “continue to proceed to increase all of the energy sources that we have.”

But she was interrupted by the Democrat, who repeated her question: “Why are you prioritizing your payouts to your shareholders instead of working to increase the oil supply?” Cortez Masto then asked Hirstius whether Shell would be willing to forgo paying out dividends to shareholders and instead pass along those earnings from the higher gas prices to consumers. The cost per gallon of gasoline in the United States hovered around $4.30 on Wednesday, shattering a record of $4.10 set just before the financial crisis in 2008, according to the price-tracking service GasBuddy.

After the Shell executive emphasized that gas prices are something the company does not control, Cortez Masto asked for clarification about whether the oil giant would consider passing off their dividends “to consumers who are hurting right now.”

“We are committed to continue to invest and make sure that our production does not decline,” Hirstius said.

As the Russian invasion enters its third week, most Ukrainians want to keep up the fight, according to a poll released Wednesday.

Conducted by InfoSapiens , based in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, the poll offers the clearest snapshot yet of Ukrainian public opinion as Russian forces continue to shell and encircle cities in a war that analysts say is aimed at toppling Ukraine’s pro-European government and replacing it with pro-Russian proxies.

As the war drags on, public opinion in Ukraine appears to continue to harden against Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the latest poll. The study was commissioned by the British research agency ORB International and carried out using a random sampling of cellphones March 3 and 4.

Drone footage published Thursday by Ukraine’s Defense Ministry appears to show an ambush on a column of Russian armored vehicles north of Kyiv.

In the footage from Brovary, a city 15 miles from the capital, several vehicles are attacked, sparking panic among the battalion’s drivers. Black tracks are left etched on the road as some try to swerve and escape.

The footage was verified by The Washington Post and analyzed by Ukraine Weapons Tracker, a Twitter account analyzing the types of arms and equipment being utilized in the war, and Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that the battalion’s commander, which it identified as a Col. Zakharov, was killed in the attack. No further details were provided.

The video, which bears the watermark of the Azov brigade, a far-right armed group that forms part of Ukraine’s National Guard, was edited to include an audio recording purporting to contain the emergency call of a Russian soldier in the aftermath of one of the attacks.

“The head of the cortege got into a trap,” the voice says. “The regiment commander died. Figuring out about the others now.”

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry did not specify where the recording came from, and it could not be independently verified.
Berlin erects tents for refugees but says it’s not the beginning of a tent city

BERLIN — Now that more than 2.3 million refugees have fled Ukraine, with potentially more than a million still to come, the question of how smoothly they can be absorbed into destination countries looms large.

Some observers expressed concern that tents erected in Berlin this week were a worrying sign — perhaps the beginning of long-term tent cities. But Berlin officials said the tents are primarily to help people stay warm while waiting their turn to register as refugees at the main arrival center. People have been staying one night at most, officials said, before buses take them to shelters across the country.

While Poland has received the greatest number of refugees, officials in Berlin estimate that they are registering thousands of new arrivals each day.

“It’s a destination that many people know and head for, especially those who do not have familial connections or networks in Poland, where many Ukrainians have lived before,” said Monika Hebbinghaus, a spokeswoman for the state office of refugee affairs.

The European Union is extending up to three years of “temporary protection” to Ukrainian nationals, allowing them to work and access public services while bypassing the usual lengthy asylum process. Some refugees from Ukraine are staying with family or friends already living in the E.U. But those without connections, along with non-Ukrainians who fled the war, are seeking shelter under the structures initially built for Syrian refugees in 2015.
Bolton says Russia didn’t invade Ukraine sooner because ‘Putin saw Trump doing a lot of his work for him’

Former national security adviser John Bolton claimed that one of the reasons Russian President Vladimir Putin did not invade Ukraine sooner was because of Bolton’s old boss, former president Donald Trump.

In an interview with SiriusXM’s Julie Mason, Bolton, who has gone from Trump official to critic, said the world would be in “a lot worse shape” at this point of the invasion if Trump had gone through with his threat to withdraw the United States from NATO. Trump has recently sought to rewrite history on his approach to NATO and Ukraine, The Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler wrote on the Fact Checker .

“I think one of the reasons Putin did not move during Trump’s term in office was he saw the president’s hostility in NATO,” Bolton said late Wednesday. “It was widely reported in American media, and to Putin’s mind, it’s a binary proposition, a weaker NATO is a stronger Russia.”

Bolton, who recently said Trump “ barely knew where Ukraine was ,” then went one step further in his assessment of why Putin did not launch his invasion earlier.

“Putin saw Trump doing a lot of his work for him and thought maybe in a second term, Trump would make good on his desire to get out of NATO and then it would just ease Putin’s path just that much more,” he said.
Rep. Madison Cawthorn calls Zelensky a ‘thug,’ says Ukrainian government is ‘incredibly evil’

Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) recently called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a “thug” and said the Ukrainian government is “incredibly evil,” in remarks that are at odds with the broad bipartisan support for Ukraine among American lawmakers and the public amid Russia’s invasion.

“Remember that Zelensky is a thug. Remember that the Ukrainian government is incredibly corrupt, and it is incredibly evil, and it has been pushing woke ideologies,” Cawthorn told supporters at a recent event in North Carolina, according to video published Thursday by Raleigh-based TV station WRAL .

Cawthorn, 26, is in his first term in the House and is a vocal supporter of former president Donald Trump, who has recently praised Russian President Vladimir Putin’s handling of the invasion as “genius” and “savvy.”

The congressman’s comments were first reported Wednesday night by Republican strategist Karl Rove in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.

In a statement, Cawthorn spokesman Luke Ball said the lawmaker was referring to pro-Ukraine misinformation.

“The Congressman was expressing his displeasure at how foreign leaders, including Zelensky, had recently used false propaganda to entice America into becoming involved in an overseas conflict,” Ball said. “He supports Ukraine and the Ukrainian President’s efforts to defend their country against Russian aggression, but does not want America drawn into another conflict through emotional manipulation.”
