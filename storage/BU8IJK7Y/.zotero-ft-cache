People lie on mattresses in the underground parking lot of a hotel that has been turned into a bomb shelter during an air raid alert in Kyiv, Ukraine, Sunday, Feb. 27, 2022. Terrified men, women and children sought safety inside and underground, and the government maintained a 39-hour curfew to keep people off the streets as more than 150,000 Ukrainians fled to neighboring countries and the United Nations warned the number could grow to 4 million if fighting escalates.

    Opinion | The Market Is Not Enough

    Russia’s war should remind conservatives that government intervention is sometimes in order to protect U.S. national security.

    Opinion by RICH LOWRY

    03/10/2022 04:13 PM EST

    The Russian invasion of Ukraine is one of those events that everyone says “changes everything.” But there are many such events, and often not much changes at all.

    In the case of Putin’s war, it certainly looks like an inflection point in Europe, with Germany saying it’s going to rearm and Europe talking of weaning itself from Russian energy.

    The question is whether Russia’s brazen act of aggression, coupled with Moscow’s de facto alliance with another revanchist power, China, sets in motion needed changes here in the United States.

    The new, more threatening era underlines the urgency of what should have already been priorities. We need a much bigger defense budget; we need an all-of-the-above energy policy that takes full advantage of our Saudi Arabia-like bounty of fossil fuels; and we need to use public policy to ensure we are meeting national needs not necessarily fulfilled by the free market alone.

    Russian energy sanctions unite the feuding parties — for now

    The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine remains the main driver behind the legislation.

    By JOSH SIEGEL

    03/10/2022 01:33 PM EST

    The invasion of Ukraine has managed to unite Republicans and Democrats on an energy policy for the first time in years — but don't expect it to last.

    The House passed last night a bipartisan bill to prohibit shipments of Russian fossil fuels to the U.S. in a bid to squeeze the commodities that provide a crucial economic lifeline for Vladimir Putin's regime. Each party, though, hopes the blocking of oil and petroleum imports will benefit their larger priorities — with Republicans continuing to push for more domestic drilling while Democrats champion action on climate change.

    “We draw completely opposite conclusions,” said Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas).

    The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine remains the main driver behind the legislation, which comes after President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced an executive action banning Russian energy imports. The House bill is largely a messaging exercise because the Senate is not expected to take it up and oil traders are already shunning Russian cargoes for fear of being caught up in financial sanctions.

    ‘People are going to get real nervous’: Oil shock upends Fed strategy

    The Fed is set to begin hiking borrowing costs next week in a bid to rein in consumer prices.

    By VICTORIA GUIDA and STEVEN OVERLY

    03/10/2022 12:51 PM EST

    Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to further disrupt global supply chains just as shipping delays were poised to improve, scrambling the economic outlook and the Federal Reserve’s strategy for fighting inflation along with it.

    The Fed is set to begin hiking borrowing costs next week in a bid to rein in consumer prices, which the government said Thursday rose at the fastest pace in four decades. But central bank policymakers like Chair Jerome Powell had also voiced hope that supply shortages would soon begin to subside, helping them curb inflation without sharply restricting economic activity. Indeed, logistics experts were optimistic heading into March, with workers returning to the labor force and filling staffing gaps as the pandemic fades.

    But Russia’s attack in late February sent oil prices surging some 25 percent over the following two weeks. Energy costs are expected to remain high, making the transportation of goods much more expensive. Shipping routes around the war-torn region must now be recalibrated, and more than 300,000 companies in the U.S. and Europe alone could see disruptions, one supply chain software CEO estimated .

    Higher costs at the gas pump already contributed significantly to inflation in February, which rose at a blistering 0.8 percent rate from the previous month and 7.9 percent over the past year, the highest since 1982, according to consumer price index data released Thursday.

    Opinion | Foreign Fighters Are Heading to Ukraine. That’s A Moment for Worry

    Volunteering to fight for freedom may feel noble, but it adds some big risks to a volatile situation.

    Opinion by NAUREEN C. FINK and COLIN P. CLARKE

    03/10/2022 12:09 PM EST

    As if echoing the passions of the Spanish Civil War when thousands of idealistic foreigners came to fight fascism, the Ukrainian government's fight against Vladimir Putin has now begun to attract foreign volunteers ready to defend Ukraine’s democratically elected government.

    Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the establishment of an international legion for volunteers. “This will be the key evidence of your support for our country,” he said.

    As images of Russian atrocities pile up, reports suggest the call has been widely heeded, with volunteers traveling from near and far to join — many from the Ukrainian diaspora, but also from further afield. According to Zelenskyy, more than 16,000 foreigners volunteered to fight in the first week of the conflict; just a few days later Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba put that number closer to 20,000 . Fighters have reportedly arrived from 52 countries , including the United States, Canada, Finland, Georgia, Sweden, Czech Republic, France, Belgium and Belarus.

    Several leaders have even offered an outright endorsement for their citizens to fight Putin by proxy in Ukraine. U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss voiced support for Britons going to fight in Ukraine because those fighting Russians are “fighting for freedom and democracy not just for Ukraine but for the whole of Europe.” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said “It’s a choice that anyone can make. This goes for all Ukrainians who live here, but also for others who think they can contribute directly to the conflict.” Some Danes don’t have to be asked twice.

    Senators clash as Congress labors to finish $1.5T spending bill

    The chamber's leaders need the consent of all 100 senators to move forward quickly, and Republicans are demanding another amendment vote on vaccine mandates.

    Tempers flared on the Senate floor Thursday afternoon over a $1.5 trillion spending deal, complicating efforts to dispatch it to President Biden’s desk.

    Party leaders are still hopeful to pass the legislation on Thursday evening, a move that requires agreement of all 100 senators — and even if that can't happen, Congress has enough time to avoid a shutdown. But while those private negotiations played out, bad feelings over the bill spilled out in public.

    Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) sought to separate out a vote on $14 billion in Ukraine aid, arguing that would help deliver aid more quickly. Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) objected, leaving both legislators fuming afterward. After Tester contended that trying to change the spending bill now would result in a government shutdown, Scott responded: “What the hell are we doing here?”

    “The House is not in session. To say that we’re going to pass it and presto change-o, it goes right to the president’s desk? That’s not how the process works,” Tester said. “You can say that we’re blocking this aid? No, no, no, no. The good senator from Florida is blocking this bill.”

    Shot down: How Biden scuttled the deal to get MiGs to Ukraine

    After an errant comment, rapid-fire negotiations and blunt announcements, the plan to send warplanes to Ukraine is no more.

    By PAUL MCLEARY , ALEXANDER WARD and BETSY WOODRUFF SWAN

    03/10/2022 09:37 AM EST

    A three-way fighter-jet deal to bolster Ukraine’s defenses against Russia is dead — just five days after the White House first revealed an openness to making it work.

    With Kyiv begging U.S. officials for more military support, the prospect of Ukraine reaping a windfall of MiG fighter jets caught the world’s attention this past week as the country fights back Russia’s invading forces. But after a dizzying series of public statements, diplomatic messaging and blunt offers to swap the Russian-made planes for American aircraft, it all fell apart.

    The saga that started 11 days ago with an errant comment by a top European Union diplomat ended unceremoniously when the chief Pentagon spokesperson and the head of the U.S. European Command separately declared Wednesday that the U.S. wouldn’t take part in an agreement to give warplanes to Poland after it sends its fleet to Ukraine.

    “We do not support the transfer of the fighters to the Ukrainian air force at this time and have no desire to see them in our custody either,” John Kirby told reporters, conveying the main sentiment of a Wednesday phone call between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Polish counterpart . He added that the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence community assessed the warplanes wouldn’t materially improve Ukraine’s chances, but instead would escalate the prospects of drawing NATO directly into the fight.

    ‘We should all be watching’: Harris says U.N. should probe Putin’s ‘atrocities’ in Ukraine

    But the vice president stopped short of assessing that Russia had committed war crimes.

    By QUINT FORGEY

    03/10/2022 09:04 AM EST

    Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday said the United States would participate in investigations by the United Nations to determine if Russia has committed war crimes during its invasion of Ukraine.

    Harris, speaking at a joint news conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda, accused Russia of committing “atrocities” amid the two-week conflict, citing what the international community has already “been able to see” in images and videos of Ukraine’s devastated urban centers.

    “When it comes to crimes and violations of international norms and rules, we are also very clear that any intentional attack on innocent civilians is a violation. The U.N. has set up a process by which there will be a review and investigations, and we will of course participate as appropriate and necessary,” Harris said.

    “But we all watched the television coverage of just yesterday,” she continued. “That’s on top of everything else that we know and don’t know yet, based on what we’ve just been able to see. And because we’ve seen it or not doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened.”

    Ready to Die? Why Most People Flunk the Zelenskyy Test.

    Tyranny has triumphed in recent years because real courage is rare.

    By JOHN F. HARRIS

    03/10/2022 04:30 AM EST

    In his bid for international support for Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has found a good line, and he knows it.

    “This might be the last time you see me alive,” he told European leaders in a conference call, shortly after his country was invaded. He repeated the words a few days later as he pleaded with House and Senate members for more U.S. assistance.

    Zelenskyy’s warning of his imminent demise is powerful for two reasons. One is that it is self-evidently credible. The Ukrainian president’s public willingness to court death to defend his country is probably now his best protection against death. Zelenskyy’s new stature — suddenly, he is likely the free world’s most admired person — has increased the costs Russian President Vladimir Putin will pay if Zelenskyy is killed during the Ukraine invasion. But no one, least of all Zelenskyy, can have much confidence that Putin cares about those costs.

    That leads to the other reason Zelenskyy’s reminders that he may be days or hours away from his own death are so arresting. His message is a barely cloaked taunt for everyone cheering him from a distance: How much are you willing to sacrifice for your beliefs?

    Crypto firms under attack for sticking with Russia

    As more banks and payment systems cut off service to ordinary Russians in response to the conflict, digital asset firms are being forced to navigate the same reputational minefields as traditional financial institutions. 

    By SAM SUTTON

    03/10/2022 04:30 AM EST

    Pressure is mounting on the cryptocurrency industry to block access to Russians as economic sanctions push the ruble to the edge of collapse.

    The wide-ranging sanctions and a growing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine have sent technology firms, internet providers and credit card companies racing for the exits. But top crypto platforms have held firm on continuing to offer Russian users a potential digital haven.

    While the exchanges insist that they’re working to block sanctioned oligarchs and institutions from their platforms, the Ukrainian government and U.S. Democrats led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are blasting crypto asset service providers for continuing to operate in Russia at all even as others have fled.

    “MasterCard has done it . Visa has done it . Amex has done it ,” Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), a crypto critic and senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview. “In the U.S., these crypto exchanges aren't doing it. Why have they chosen to be less moral than Visa and MasterCard?”

    House approves ban on import of Russian oil

    Nancy Pelosi said the vote was necessary even though President Joe Biden took executive action.

    By ANDREW DESIDERIO

    03/09/2022 11:32 PM EST

    The House passed legislation Wednesday night banning U.S. imports of Russian oil and other energy sources, as lawmakers look to escalate U.S.-led sanctions on Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine.

    House Democratic leaders decided to move forward with the vote even though President Joe Biden announced a Russian oil embargo on Tuesday. The Senate is not expected to consider the House-passed bill, with upper-chamber Democrats wary of tying Biden’s hands.

    Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that regardless of Biden’s executive action, it was necessary for the House to take further steps against Russia as Putin escalates his brutal assault on Ukraine, targeting civilian areas including hospitals and residential neighborhoods.

    “We’ve been talking about doing the Russian ban for a while. And we’re so pleased that the president has done that,” said Pelosi, who spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for 45 minutes earlier Wednesday. “But you’re here in a legislature. This is a democratic process where people weigh the equities, express their views.”

    Kamala Harris finds herself center stage of the Ukraine crisis

    The vice president arrives in Poland amid a worsening war and a disagreement over how to exchange fighter jets. It’s her toughest, biggest foreign policy stage yet.

    Vice President Kamala Harris’ trip to Poland on Wednesday comes amid tense times in the region and difficult negotiations between Warsaw and Washington.

    But administration officials say she’s not there to make any deals, whether it be on humanitarian aid or the transfer of military equipment. Instead, her role is to serve as an emissary and an emblem of the administration’s commitment to the country and the trans-Atlantic alliance more broadly.

    The vice president has been trying to build her chops as a serious foreign policy player, an image that's eluded her throughout her career. But the backdrop for her trip has changed dramatically since it was first announced on March 4. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine rages on Poland’s doorstep, forcing more than 2 million people to flee their homes. And, in the last 24 hours, Warsaw and Washington openly sparred over a plan to send Polish MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, before the Biden administration put the deal on ice for fear of escalating tensions further with Moscow.

    There’s no indication that Harris’ trip was aimed at dealing with that impasse. Rather, administration officials and allies say her goal is to bring sensitive requests back to the president and to reaffirm Washington’s commitment to help Ukraine and others affected by the Russian invasion.

    House to punt Covid aid to the Senate amid funding feud

    A portion of the domestic and international funds to continue battling the pandemic will no longer come out of unspent state funding.

    By ALICE MIRANDA OLLSTEIN

    03/09/2022 05:43 PM EST

    The House of Representatives plans to take a standalone vote Wednesday on $15.6 billion in new Covid-19 funding, after removing the money from a broader $1.5 trillion spending package , which includes aid for Ukraine, Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed.

    A portion of the domestic and international funds to continue battling the pandemic will no longer come out of unspent state funding after a revolt by House Democrats derailed that plan earlier on Wednesday.

    While the move clears the way for the House to pass the other government and military funding, it imperils passage of the Covid money in the Senate, where most Republicans are opposed to new spending on the pandemic without first seeing a full accounting of the trillions Congress has pumped out over the past few years.

    Pelosi, during a press conference, acknowledged this impasse.

    Opinion | Why Putin Can’t Win the Propaganda War at Home

    The autocrat’s playbook doesn’t work as well in today’s media era.

    Opinion by JACK SHAFER

    03/09/2022 05:42 PM EST

    Vladimir Putin slipped a noose around the throat of independent Russian media last week, and with a few tugs has begun to choke the life from it.

    Drawing on his existing legal powers and new ones passed by the Russian legislature — which forbids the spread of information that contradicts the official Russian take on the Ukraine war, punishable by 15 years in prison — Putin has silenced domestic critics of his regime. In reaction to the new measures, opposition radio station Ekho Moskvy and TV Dozhd (Rain) have closed shop . Mediazona, which covers political arrests, Snob magazine, the Agentstvo investigative news site and others have been blocked by the government. Access to Facebook and Twitter has been interrupted , and Russians can no longer upload to Tik Tok. Many international news organizations have either abandoned their Russia bureaus or curtailed their reporting.

    The clampdown has relegated the war to news outlets that agree to call the Ukraine invasion a “special military operation,” that proclaim as “fake” the bombed-city footage we’ve been watching, and that assert that Russian troops are “rescuing” Russian-speaking people from “Nazis.” Official Russian propaganda has now obliterated what was — by Soviet standards, at least — a relatively free media environment. That doesn’t mean Putin has been a free speech radical during his time in office. The New Yorker noted his general hostility to open expression last summer and his regime's attacks on journalists are well-documented .

    But information technology has gained a significant toehold in Russia, making it difficult for the state to blot out the messages it disdains, and the country’s younger citizens have been exposed to too many Western experiences through travel and media to ever swallow whole government propaganda again. Whether he knows it or not, Putin seems doomed to lose an extended propaganda war at home.

    'We are on war footing': Granholm calls on oil companies to ramp up production

    By BEN LEFEBVRE

    03/09/2022 05:30 PM EST

    Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on Wednesday exhorted the oil industry to produce more fuel to help offset the global energy supply shock as the U.S. is now in a "war footing" triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

    Granholm’s speech to executives at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston aimed to ease the industry’s worries that the Biden administration had not sought its aid to smooth an oil market that touched $130 a barrel earlier in the week amid fears over global energy supply. Industry officials had complained that the Biden administration, which has discussed getting more oil supply from Venezuela and other foreign sources, needed to explicitly call upon domestic energy producers to speed their drills.

    “We are on war footing," Granholm said. “That means [crude oil] releases from the strategic reserves all around the world. And that means you producing more right now if and when you can. I hope your investors are saying this to you as well. In this moment of crisis, we need more supply.”

    Gasoline prices have climbed steadily for the better part of a year, reaching an average of $4.25 a gallon on Wednesday. Oil traders wary of international financial sanctions against Moscow are avoiding Russian crude, taking millions of barrels of oil off the market and threatening to send prices for American drivers even higher.

    MARIUPOL, Ukraine — A Russian airstrike devastated a maternity hospital Wednesday in the besieged port city of Mariupol amid growing warnings from the West that Moscow’s invasion is about to take a more brutal and indiscriminate turn. Ukrainian officials said at least 17 people were wounded in the attack.

    The ground shook more than a mile away when the Mariupol complex was hit by a series of blasts that blew out windows and ripped away much of the front of one building. Police and soldiers rushed to scene to evacuate victims, carrying out a heavily pregnant and bleeding woman on a stretcher.

    Another woman wailed as she clutched her child. In the courtyard, mangled cars burned, and a blast crater extended at least two stories deep.

    “Today Russia committed a huge crime,” said Volodymir Nikulin, a top regional police official, standing in the ruins. “It is a war crime without any justification.”

    By ANDY BLATCHFORD

    03/09/2022 03:36 PM EST

    OTTAWA, Ont. — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says Russia’s war on Ukraine is forcing the military alliance to launch an urgent rethink of its long-term strategy.

    “We need to … have a serious assessment of the longer-term adaptation of NATO — our posture, our presence and also how we can strengthen our ability to reinforce quickly,” Stoltenberg said during a virtual session of an Ottawa defense conference Wednesday when asked if Russia's assault on Ukraine will force NATO to establish a permanent line of defense in eastern Europe.

    “We stepped up during the autumn and especially after the invasion. But then there will also be some more longer-term changes.”

    Stoltenberg said the deliberations will start during next week’s meeting of NATO defense ministers. Final decisions on the alliance's new direction should be made closer to the NATO summit in late June, he said after delivering a speech to the CDA Institute’s Ottawa Conference.

    U.S. closes door on sending fighter jets to Ukraine

    U.S. officials on Wednesday all but shut the door on arming Ukraine with fighter jets, one day after the Pentagon rejected a Polish proposal that would have transferred MiG-29 aircraft to the Ukrainian government via an American airbase in Germany.

    Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin notified Polish Minister of National Defense Mariusz Błaszczak on a phone call Wednesday that the U.S. would not support a transfer of jets to Ukraine, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said.

    “Secretary Austin thanked the minister for Poland’s willingness to continue to look for ways to assist Ukraine, but he stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian air force at this time, and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody, either,” Kirby said in a briefing at the Pentagon on Wednesday afternoon.

    On Tuesday, Poland announced plans to send 28 Russian-made MiG jets to a U.S. and NATO base in Germany, aircraft that then could be transferred to Ukraine. That announcement from the Polish government followed a week of back-and-forth negotiation between Warsaw and Washington, though Tuesday’s announcement came as a surprise to U.S. officials.

    The Biden administration is facing mounting pressure to get more involved in the war in Ukraine.

    But with every move that lawmakers, allied countries and Ukrainians themselves demand, administration officials worry that the risk of becoming a direct participant in the war grows.

    This week, a spat with an ally over supplying fighter jets to Ukraine burst into the open , underscoring how the White House is trying to strike a cautious balance between supporting Kyiv with weapons while keeping out of Moscow's line of fire.

    The pressure is coming from an array of parties: from lawmakers demanding the United States share more intelligence with Ukraine; to national security specialists and Ukrainian leaders calling for it to establish some form of a no-fly zone over the besieged country; to Poland trying to hand over its fighter jets to Ukrainian pilots.

    'This crisis will accelerate the energy transition'

    But surging energy prices could highlight industry weakness.

    The U.S. oil industry is on an upswing, buoyed by the surge in gasoline prices to a record $4.25 a gallon Wednesday, sky-high crude oil prices and even some begrudging praise from President Joe Biden as he announced a ban on Russian energy imports.

    But the rally-around-the-rig sentiment in the U.S. from the energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine may not last long, and experts say the consumer pain from the fuel price spike could hasten the shift away from oil in the U.S. and toward cleaner energy sources.

    The price at the pump, which the American Automobile Association says has leaped 75 cents per gallon in the past month because of the invasion of Ukraine, is likely to push more people to consider electric vehicles, which are slowly gaining market momentum as carmakers roll out new models. And that gasoline price rise, led by the rally in crude prices to 14-year highs, is offering some companies and policymakers a ready-made national security argument to push for more green energy projects as insulation against oil price shocks.

    “This crisis will accelerate the energy transition,” said Marcel van Poecke, managing director at Carlyle International Energy Partners. ”People will say we don’t want to be dependent any more.”

    Biden calls family of former U.S. Marine jailed in Russia

    Trevor Reed's situation has gotten new attention since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

    President Joe Biden on Tuesday spoke with the family of a former U.S. Marine detained in Russia, vowing to do “everything he can” to bring Trevor Reed home.

    The president called Trevor Reed’s parents, Joe and Paula, and his sister, Taylor, after his trip to Fort Worth, Texas, where Biden met with veterans. The Reed family lives less than an hour from Fort Worth and waited for Biden’s motorcade to pass through in hopes of holding an in-person meeting with the president. Paula Reed held a hot pink sign that said, “Bring my son home!” and Biden appeared to acknowledge her message with a hand gesture, the Dallas Morning News reported .

    “The president called Joey and Paula Reed to reiterate his commitment to do everything he can to bring their son home, to staying in close touch with them through his national security team, and to finding a time to meet in person,” a White House official said afterward.

    Trevor Reed has been in prison in Russia for more than two years. He was arrested in Moscow in 2019 after a night of drinking and was sentenced to nine years in prison on assault charges for endangering the “life and health” of Russian police officers. Both Trevor and his family have vehemently denied the charges; U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan has condemned them as “absurd.”
