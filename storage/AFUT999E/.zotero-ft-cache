A western ban on Russian oil imports may more than double the price to $300 a barrel and prompt the closure of the main gas pipeline to Germany, Moscow has warned.

Oil prices spiked to their highest levels since 2008, although Brent crude slipped 0.7% to $122.30 on Tuesday morning after shooting up to $138 briefly on Monday. The all-time high is $147.50.

    March 7, 2022 

“A rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market,” said Russian deputy prime minister Alexander Novak, saying the price could more than double to over $300 per barrel.

Oil prices at such high levels would be crippling to western economies and would also send the price of natural gas soaring even higher than the already record levels.

Germany last month froze the certification of Nord Stream 2 that was due to pipe gas from Russia to Germany.

“We have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline,” said Novak .

A number of people, including children, have been killed in aerial attacks on Sumy , the regional military administrator has said on Facebook, according to the BBC.

The Kyiv Independent also reported the deaths in the north-eastern city.

    The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent)

    ⚡️Children among dead after Russian air raid on residential buildings in Sumy.

    Head of Sumy Regional State Administration Dmitry Zhivitsky said in a video message on Facebook on March 7 that at least 10 people were killed as a result of targeted bombings by Russia on Sumy.
    March 8, 2022 

Sumy has come under fierce attack from the Russians and was one of the cities where a ceasefire was proposed to allow civilians to escape on Monday. However, the Ukraine government rejected the plan after it emerged that some of the “humanitarian corridors” led to Russia or Belarus.

We reported earlier that a senior Russian commander, Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of the 41st Army, has been killed in fighting in Kharkiv.

Our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, reports that the death of the decorated veteran of campaigns in Chechnya, Syria and the Crimea was reported by Ukrainian intelligence after it picked up a telephone conversation between two FSB officers discussing the death.

Other senior officers are believed to have been killed as well.

The two FSB officers also lament that their secure communications were no longer functioning inside Ukraine .

Ukraine much closer to joining EU, says Kuleba

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, has made some very positive noises about the prospects of Ukraine being admitted to the European Union., according to Ukraine’s Unian website .

After a call to the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, on Monday, he said that while distance to EU membership had been as far away as the Moon last week, it was now only from Kyiv to the Ukraine city of Vinnitsa – a distance of just 262km or 162 miles.

    The situation has changed. I won’t talk about which specific countries are now skeptical for now, but some of those countries that were negative now really support us. Some still don’t. But wait. This week will be serious news related to our membership in the European Union.

    A week ago, let’s say, before joining the EU, we were about the same as from Kyiv to the Moon. And now our accession to the EU is about the same as from Kyiv to Vinnitsa.

Kuleba’s energetic diplomacy also included calls to UK foreign secretary Liz Truss and US secretary of state Anthony Blinken.

    Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba)

    Call with @trussliz on practical steps to further strengthen Ukraine’s defense capabilities. I underscored the urgent need to impose new sanctions on Russia for its continued barbaric war crimes in Ukraine. Grateful to the UK for standing by Ukraine at this critical time.

    Another call with @SecBlinken . We are coordinating intensively on crucial further steps to increase pressure on Russia. As long as Putin refuses to end his meaningless and barbaric war on Ukraine, the pressure will be getting higher. Grateful to the U.S. for standing by Ukraine.

'Europe could wean itself off Russian gas', says commission's climate chief

Energy is fast-becoming the key battleground in the west’s economic war on Russia. It has been seen as the weakest part of the west’s defences but the US, UK and Europe are in discussions about reducing dependency on Russian oil and gas.

Such a move would choke off the Kremlin’s main source of cash, but also wipe out Vladimir Putin’s main source of leverage over European countries, especially Germany. Russia supplies around 40% of Europe’s gas.

To this end, the European Commission’s climate policy chief said on Monday that Europe could wean itself off Russian gas within years and start curbing its reliance within months.

Frans Timmermans said the plans would “substantially reduce our dependency on Russian gas already this year, and within years will make us independent of the import of Russian gas”.

“It’s not easy, but it’s feasible,” he told European Parliament’s environment committee.

A draft of the Commission plan, seen by Reuters, has several main points:

    cut dependency by increasing gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from other countries, and phasing in alternative gases like hydrogen and biomethane.
    build wind and solar projects faster, and ensure countries fill gas storage before winter to cushion supply shocks.
    fill Europe’s gas storage needs to be 80-90% ahead of next winter. EU gas storage was around 75% full on Sep. 30 last year.


Countries are still divided about the plan. On Monday Olaf Schloz, the German chancellor, said Russian energy imports were “essential” to Europeans’ daily lives and cautioned against banning Russian oil and gas as part of Western sanctions.

Summary

Here are some of the main developments in the last few hours.

    Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has rallied the nation again in his late-night video address, saying “You do not back down. We do not back down”, adding that “heroic” resistance was making the war “like a nightmare” for Russia.
    Zelenskiy also again accused Russia of attacking fleeing civilians. Earlier on Monday his government rejected an offer from Moscow to create “humanitarian corridors” for the escape of civilians after it emerged that most of the supposedly safe routes led directly to Russia or Belarus. He accused Moscow of “medieval” tactics.
    The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine is deepening as Russian forces intensify their attacks, while food, water, heat and medicine grow increasingly scarce. Some 1.7m Ukrainians are thought to have fled the fighting and the total could reach 5m, the EU said.
    A western ban on Russian oil imports may more than double the price to $300 a barrel and prompt the closure of the main gas pipeline to Germany, Moscow warned on Monday.
    Britain’s home secretary is under fire for the country’s “chaotic policy” towards Ukrainians seeking refuge in the UK. Only 300 have been granted asylum so far.
    Zelenskiy will address UK MPs on Tuesday via videolink and is expected to plead for more arms and a no-fly zone over Ukraine to be enforced by Nato.
    A senior Russian general has been killed in fighting in Kharkiv , according to Ukraine’s defence ministry. It said its forces killed Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov, believed to have been first deputy commander of Russia’s 41st army.
    China’s foreign minister has called the country’s relationship with Russia “iron clad” as Beijing continues to refuse to condemn the invasion of Ukraine despite growing pressure from the US and European Union to use its influence to rein in Moscow.
    Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations , accused Vladimir Putin of having a plan “to brutalize Ukraine” , as the UN tries to negotiate evacuation corridors. Russia’s ambassador hit back , claiming Ukrainians are shelling themselves.

China’s foreign minister has called the country’s relationship with Russia “iron clad” as Beijing continues to refuse to condemn the invasion of Ukraine despite growing pressure from the US and European Union to use its influence to rein in Moscow.

Wang Yi said on Monday that Russia was his country’s “most important strategic partner” and ties with Moscow constituted “one of the most crucial bilateral relationships in the world”.

China has broken with the U.S., Europe and others that have imposed sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. Beijing has said sanctions create new issues and threaten a political settlement of the conflict.

Wang told reporters in Beijing:

    No matter how perilous the international landscape, we will maintain our strategic focus and promote the development of a comprehensive China-Russia partnership in the new era. The friendship between the two peoples is iron clad.

Russian generals killed in fighting, reports claim

A senior Russian general has been killed in fighting in Kharkiv , according to Ukraine’s defence ministry.

The ministry tweeted on Monday that its forces had killed Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov. He is believed to have been first deputy commander of Russia’s 41st army.

    ⚡️Ukraine’s Defense Ministry reports that Russian Major-General Vitaly Gerasimov was killed in action near Kharkiv.

    The report also says other high-rank Russian officers were hit. If true, moral among Russian officers is about to plummet.
    March 7, 2022 

It follows reports that another senior Russian commander was killed in Ukraine last week.

Maj Gen Andrei Sukhovetsky, commander of an airborne division, was killed in fighting on 28 February, an officers’ organisation in Russia reported, according to Newsweek . Multiple other reports also say Sukhovetsky, who was also said to have been a special forces commander and Syria veteran, was killed by a Ukrainian sniper.

A new nuclear research facility in Kharkiv was reportedly damaged by shelling, according to an update from the Atomic Energy Agency. There were not any detected increases in radiation near the damaged facility in north-eastern Ukraine, which produces radioisotopes and is used for research and development. But the issue has alarmed regulators who are to urgently highlighting the rising risks.

“We have already had several episodes compromising safety at Ukraine’s nuclear sites,” General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement. The agency is working to ensure nuclear safety during the conflict. “We must take action to help avert a nuclear accident in Ukraine that could have severe consequences for public health and the environment. We can’t afford to wait,” Grossi said.

Russian forces captured Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant after a night of shelling that produced a fire in a nearby building used for training. IAEA officials expressed “grave concern” over how Europe’s largest plant was being handled, which is now being overseen by a Russian commander. On Sunday, Gross said the takeover “contravenes one of the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security” highlighting the importance that staff continue their safety and security duties “free of undue pressure”.

The Ukraine Presidential Office has released the full transcript of the 9-minute address from Zelensky, given in a video from his office on Monday night:

    Monday. Evening. You know, we used to say: Monday is a hard day. There is a war in the country. So every day is Monday.

    And now we are used to the fact that every day and every night are like that.

    Today is the 12th. 12th evening of our struggle. Our defense.

    We are all on the ground, we are all working.

    Everyone is where they should be. I am in Kyiv. My team is with me. The territorial defense is on the ground. The servicemen are in positions. Our heroes! Doctors, rescuers, transporters, diplomats, journalists...

    Everyone. We are all at war. We all contribute to our victory, which will definitely be achieved. By force of arms and our army. By force of words and our diplomacy. By force of spirit, which the first, the second and each of us have.

    Take a look at our country today.

    Chaplynka, Melitopol, Tokmak, Novotroitske and Kherson. Starobilsk. Everywhere people defended themselves, although they do not have weapons there. But these are our people, and that’s why they have weapons.

    They have courage. Dignity. And hence the ability to go out and say: I’m here, it’s mine, and I won’t give it away. My city. My community. My Ukraine .

    Every Ukrainian man and woman who protested against the invaders yesterday, today and will protest tomorrow are heroes.

    We shout at the invaders together with you. We stand in the squares and streets with you. We are not afraid with you when the invaders open fire and try to drive everyone away.

    YOU do not back down.

    WE do not back down.

    And the one who repeated: “We are one people” - certainly did not expect such a powerful reaction.

    In the south of our country, such a national movement has unfolded, such a powerful manifestation of Ukrainianness that we have never seen in the streets and squares there. And for Russia it is like a nightmare.

    They forgot that we are not afraid of paddy wagons and batons. We are not afraid of tanks and machine guns. When the main thing is on our side, truth. As it is now.

    Mariupol and Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy. Odesa and Kyiv. Mykolaiv. Zhytomyr and Korosten. Ovruch. And many other cities.

    We know that hatred that the enemy brought to our cities with shelling and bombing will not remain there. There will be no trace of it. Hatred is not about us. Therefore, there will be no trace of the enemy. We will rebuild everything. We will make our cities destroyed by the invader better than any city in Russia.

    Enerhodar. Chornobyl. And other places where barbarians just don’t understand WHAT they want to capture. WHAT they want to control. Your work, your hard work on critical objects is a real feat. And we see it. We are sincerely grateful for it.

    The Ukrainian army holds positions. Well done! It inflicts extremely painful losses on the enemy. Defends. Counterattacks. If necessary - can take revenge. Necessarily. For every evil. For every rocket and bomb. For each destroyed civilian object.

    Today in Makariv, Kyiv region, they fired at the bread factory. For what? The old bread factory! Think about it - to fire at the bread factory. Who should you be to do that?

    Or to destroy another church - in the Zhytomyr region. The Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin built in 1862.

    These are NOT people.

    There was an agreement on humanitarian corridors.

    Did it work? Russian tanks worked instead. Russian “Grads”. Russian mines. They even mined the road, which was agreed to transport food and medicine for people and children in Mariupol.

    They even destroy buses that have to take people out. But ... At the same time, they are opening a small corridor to the occupied territory. For several dozen people. Not so much to Russia, as to propagandists. Directly to their TV cameras. Like, that’s the one who saves. Just cynicism. Just propaganda. Nothing more. No humanitarian sense.

    The third round of negotiations in Belarus took place today. I would like to say - the third and final. But we are realists. So we will talk. We will insist on negotiations until we find a way to tell our people: this is how we will come to peace.

    Exactly to peace.

    We must realize that every day of struggle, every day of resistance creates better conditions for us. Strong position to guarantee our future. In peace. After this war.

    Apart from the dead people and the destroyed cities, the war leaves destroyed the aspirations that once seemed very important, but now ... You don’t even mention them.

    Almost three years ago, as soon as the election took place, we entered this building, this office, and immediately began planning our move.

    I dreamed of moving from Bankova. Together with the government and parliament. To unload the center of Kyiv and in general - to move to a modern, transparent office - as befits a progressive democratic European country.

    Now I will say one thing: I stay here.

    I stay in Kyiv.

    On Bankova Street.

    I’m not hiding.

    And I’m not afraid of anyone.

    As much as it takes to win this Patriotic War of ours.

    Today I signed a decree to present state awards of Ukraine to 96 Ukrainian heroes - our military.

    Including…

    The Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the second degree is awarded to:

    Major Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Sak. Commander of the mechanized battalion who entered the battle with the battalion tactical group of the enemy and won thanks to a rational approach to combat and non-standard tactics.

    Captain Rostyslav Oleksandrovych Sylivakin. Commander of the mechanized battalion, which successfully fought the overwhelming forces of the enemy, liberating Ukrainian towns and villages in the Sumy region.

    The Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the third degree is awarded to:

    Lieutenant Ihor Serhiyovych Lozovyi. Acting as part of the group, he stopped a column of enemy vehicles numbering about 150 units, which was moving in the direction of the Zhytomyr-Kyiv route. Destroyed.

    Lieutenant Vitaliy Viktorovych Poturemets. He showed exemplary courage and composure in the battle, destroying a column of enemy equipment near the city of Kyiv. He was wounded.

    The Order “For Courage” of the third degree is awarded to:

    Master Sergeant, Commander of the Automobile Platoon Valentyn Viktorovych Baryliuk. Thanks to his brave actions and personal determination, the tank unit received fuel in time and left the encirclement, destroying the enemy on the way.

    All 96 of our heroes are like these five!

    Our gratitude to all the military.

    Our gratitude to the Armed Forces of Ukraine!

    Our gratitude is boundless.

    Glory to Ukraine!

Zelensky accused the Russian army of deliberately targeting the evacuation of civilians after talks with Moscow set corridors for their escape, Agence France-Presse reports.

“There was an agreement on humanitarian corridors. Did that work? Russian tanks worked in its place, Russian Grads (multiple rocket launchers), Russian mines,” Zelensky said in a video posted on Telegram, noting that the pathways chosen for deliveries of food and medicine in Marupol were mined by Russian forces.

He added that buses set to evacuate civilians were destroyed.

“They ensure that a small corridor to the occupied territory is open for a few dozen people. Not so much towards Russia as towards the propagandists, directly towards the television cameras,” he said.

Though Zelensky remains a prime target, he has consistently assured Ukrainians and the rest of the world that he would remain in the capital city. On 4 March, he had also spoken from his Kyiv office where a short video showed him with a colleague.

The office appearances followed a video in which Zelensky was filmed outdoors, flanked by senior aides, on 25 February, the day after the start of the invasion. “Our troops are here, citizens are here,” Zelensky said in that video, adding: “All of us are here protecting the independence of our country. And it will continue to be this way. Glory to our defenders, Glory to Ukraine , Glory to Heroes.”

• This post was amended on 8 March 2022. Volodymyr Zelensky’s 7 March video was the second from his office in 12 days, rather than the first.
