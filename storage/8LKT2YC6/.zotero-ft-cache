Latest Developments

Thanks for joining us. For the latest developments on the war in Ukraine, please follow along here .

Russian forces moved by air and land to attack Kyiv on Friday, hitting defenses across Ukraine that Western defense officials said were unexpectedly strong , while Moscow signaled openness to holding talks with the Ukrainian government.

Despite the overture, Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday excoriated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his government, comparing them to terrorists.

“They hide behind people in the hope of later blaming Russia for the civilian casualties,” Mr. Putin told a security council meeting.

After dark on Friday, Mr. Zelensky released a video of himself standing in front of the presidential headquarters in central Kyiv with his chief of staff, the country’s prime minister, and the parliament majority leader. “We are all here, defending our independence and our state. And that’s how it will be,” he said, as Russian media spread rumors of him having fled the city.

Mr. Zelensky also spoke by phone with President Biden for about 40 minutes late Friday. The Biden administration is considering additional support to the Ukrainian military. U.S. and European Union officials said they plan to impose sanctions on Mr. Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov .

Canada Supports Russia’s Removal From SWIFT Banking System

OTTAWA--Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he supports disconnecting Russia from the Swift global payment system in response to its invasion of Ukraine.“

Excluding Russian banks from Swift would make it even more difficult for President Putin to finance his brutality,” Mr. Trudeau said in a press conference on Friday.

Proponents of removing Russia from the Swift payment system argue that doing so would cause more damage to the Russian economy than targeted sanctions can . U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pressed for Russia’s removal from Swift, but some allies, including the U.S. and Germany, have so far resisted taking that step.

Conversations about removing Russia from Swift “are ongoing with our European allies, who are reflecting on this very carefully,” Mr. Trudeau said.

Canada also announced further sanctions on Friday targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr. Putin’s chief of staff, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, as well as sanctions on dozens of individuals in Belarus.

How the West Misread Vladimir Putin

For years, the former KBG agent railed against U.S. domination, assailed the post-Cold War order and sent repeated signals that he intended to widen Russia’s sphere of influence. Nonetheless, until recently few imagined he would launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Canada’s Liquor-Retail Monopolies Remove Russian Vodka

Some of Canada’s government-owned liquor retail monopolies are pulling Russian products, mostly vodka, off their shelves in response to the country’s military attack on Ukraine.

The Ontario government has instructed the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, a monopoly wine-and-spirits retailer that bills itself as one of the world’s biggest buyers of alcohol, to remove Russian vodka from its shelves. “Ontario joins Canada’s allies in condemning the Russian government’s act of aggression against the Ukrainian people,” said the province’s finance minister, Peter Bethlenfalvy. Ontario is Canada’s most-populous province, accounting for nearly 40% of the country’s population.

Liquor-retail monopolies in the east-coast provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador as well as Nova Scotia also started Friday to remove Russian spirits. Quebec's liquor-retail agency, Société des Alcools du Québec, or SAQ, said via its Twitter account that it has no plans to restock the 10 Russian products it currently carries on its shelves. "It is not the SAQ's role to play politics," it said.

In Canada, the provinces have jurisdiction over sales of wine, beer and spirits. Data from Statistics Canada indicated that provincial liquor authorities imported over 700 million Canadian dollars, or the equivalent of $546 million, of vodka for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. Vodka is the second-most popular spirit sold in the country, after whisky, Statistics Canada says.
Lawmakers Call for Deportation Protections for Ukrainians in the U.S.

Calls from lawmakers and refugee advocates are growing for the Biden administration to grant temporary protected status to Ukrainians in the U.S., shielding them from deportation while their country is under attack.

Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Thursday urged the administration to take the step on, which would offer Ukrainians without a permanent immigration status—such as international students, immigrants on temporary work visas and asylum seekers—deportation protections and work permits. Echoing his call on Friday were Sen. Alex Padilla (D., Calif.) and Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D., Calif.), the respective chairs of the Senate and House immigration subcommittees.

“Ukraine is under assault in a brazen and unprovoked invasion by Russia that has the potential to create the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II,” Mr. Padilla and Ms. Lofgren said in a joint statement.

The move could help roughly 34,000 Ukrainians living in the U.S. who are not permanent U.S. residents, according to an estimate from the Migration Policy Institute. About 4,000 Ukrainians are fighting deportation cases in the U.S., according to government data tracked by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

Administration officials are weighing the policy, according to people familiar with their thinking. The administration has shown willingness to use its broad authority to shield immigrants from deportation—granting protections this year to more than 300,000 Venezuelans and 100,000 Haitians without a permanent legal status in the U.S. So far, though, the administration has resisted advocates’ calls to issue the same protections for Afghans.

The Department of Homeland Security, which holds the power to grant the protections, didn’t respond to a request for comment.
U.S. Junk Bonds Hold Steady Through Ukraine Invasion

Moldova Says Missile Struck Oil Tanker in Black Sea
By Benoit Faucon

A missile hit a commercial oil tanker while it was in international waters in the Black Sea, Moldova authorities said.

The country's naval agency said the vessel, Millennial Spirit, a Moldova-flagged tanker, caught fire after the missile strike. The fire destroyed the ship's lifeboats, and the ship's crew abandoned the vessel with life preservers and were later picked up by Ukrainian rescue vessels, Moldova said.

A Ukrainian company operates the vessel, but its crew is Russian, the naval agency said. Moldova said it didn't know who fired the missile. The Ministry of Infrastructure of Ukraine separately blamed a Russian warship. Two crew members, including the captain, were in critical condition, the Ukrainian ministry said.

On Thursday, a projectile hit a vessel chartered by one of the world’s largest food suppliers, Cargill Inc., off the coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea. Minnesota-based Cargill, which operates an export terminal in Ukraine, said the ship is seaworthy and no one was injured.
Amid Warnings of Cyberattacks in Ukraine, U.S. Companies ‘Sitting and Waiting’

White House: Kyiv Falling to Russia Is a ‘Real Possibility’
By Andrew Restuccia

WASHINGTON—The White House warned that Kyiv could fall as Russian forces continue to advance on the city.

“Kyiv falling is a real possibility,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday. “Even as we see resistance on the ground, Russia’s military continues to advance toward Kyiv.”

U.S. officials had assessed as recently as Thursday that Kyiv could fall within 24-48 hours. U.S. officials still expect it could fall, but a senior defense official said Friday that Ukrainian resistance was stronger than the U.S. first expected and the Ukrainians had slowed the Russians’ push into the capital.
Canadian Telecoms Waive Long-Distance Fees to Ukraine

Canada's largest telecommunications companies said Friday that they are temporarily waiving long-distance and texting fees for calls to Ukraine.

A group of companies, including BCE Inc., Telus Corp., Rogers Communications Inc. and Shaw Communications, said they would not charge any fees until the end of March for calls to the country.

Rogers and Telus will also be waiving roaming charges for those in the country.

"We want everyone to stay connected right now, and not worry about their bills," said a Telus spokeswoman.

According to Statistics Canada, Canada was home to almost 1.4 million people of Ukrainian origin in 2016, one of the largest Ukrainian population centers outside of Ukraine and Russia.
