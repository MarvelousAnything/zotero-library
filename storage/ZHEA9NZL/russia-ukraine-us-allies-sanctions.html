 Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told Fox News that the U.S. must work to help 
Europe find alternative sources for energy and gas in order to limit 
Russia’s influence on the continent as he discussed possible 
sanctions.&nbsp;</p><p>
Schiff said that this attack should prompt “a wholesale effort to wean 
Europe off of Russian oil and gas so that Russia can no longer use that 
as leverage,” Schiff, chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence, said. “And I think it ought to spell at a minimum the 
final death of North Stream 2.”&nbsp;</p><p>“So I think that ought to be our response to Russia’s use of oil and gas as a geopolitical weapon.”&nbsp;</p><p>Schiff also called for President to hit Putin and his inner circle of oligarchs with financial sanctions.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="meta meta-lower"><span class="author">Posted by Peter Aitken </span><a href="#" class="share">Share</a></div></article><div class="ad-container desktop ad-h-50 ad-w-300"><div class="ad gam" id="desk-ad-lb17"></div><script>window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike){

Russian&nbsp;forces invaded&nbsp;Ukraine&nbsp;on Thursday by land, air 
and sea in the largest military attack of one state against another on 
the&nbsp;European&nbsp;continent since the Second World War.&nbsp;</p><p>The
 wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday hit cities and bases with 
airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee.
 Ukraine's government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the 
border in a "full-scale war" that could rewrite the geopolitical 
order.&nbsp;</p><p>Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the 
country severed diplomatic relations with Russia and called "on all our 
partners to do the same. By this concrete step you will demonstrate that
 you stand by Ukraine and categorically reject the most blatant act of 
aggression in Europe since WWII."</p><p>Click <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-invades-ukraine-largest-europe-attack-wwii" target="_blank" data-omtr-intcmp="lb_russian-forces-attacking-kyiv,-explosions-heard-in-ukrainian-capital:-live-updates_postclickthru_94_article1 ">here</a> to read more on Fox News.</p></div><div class="meta meta-lower"><span class="author">Posted by Danielle Wallace </span><a href="#" class="share">Share</a></div></article><article class="article-item" id="post-93" data-post-id=""><div class="meta meta-upper"><time class="time" datetime="Thu Feb 24 2022 08:49:13 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)"></time><h2 class="title">Ukrainian government officials claim forces shot down 6 Russian planes, taken 2 soldiers prisoner</h2></div><div class="content"><p></p><div class="related image-ct"><div class="m"><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/livenews.foxnews.com/images/2022/02/320/180/52af7de704d894b0d96086ec5efa28b9.jpg?tl=1&amp;ve=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/livenews.foxnews.com/images/2022/02/640/360/52af7de704d894b0d96086ec5efa28b9.jpg?tl=1&amp;ve=1 2x"><source media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/livenews.foxnews.com/images/2022/02/720/405/52af7de704d894b0d96086ec5efa28b9.jpg?tl=1&amp;ve=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/livenews.foxnews.com/images/2022/02/1440/810/52af7de704d894b0d96086ec5efa28b9.jpg?tl=1&amp;ve=1 2x"><source media="(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1279px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/livenews.foxnews.com/images/2022/02/480/270/52af7de704d894b0d96086ec5efa28b9.jpg?tl=1&amp;ve=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/livenews.foxnews.com/images/2022/02/960/540/52af7de704d894b0d96086ec5efa28b9.jpg?tl=1&amp;ve=1 2x"><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/livenews.foxnews.com/images/2022/02/624/351/52af7de704d894b0d96086ec5efa28b9.jpg?tl=1&amp;ve=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/livenews.foxnews.com/images/2022/02/1248/702/52af7de704d894b0d96086ec5efa28b9.jpg?tl=1&amp;ve=1 2x"><img src="52af7de704d894b0d96086ec5efa28b9.jpg" alt="Ukrainian government officials claim forces shot down 6 Russian planes, taken 2 soldiers prisoner"></picture></div><div class="caption"><p>A

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield is urging members of
 the General Assembly Wednesday to “get off of the sidelines and let us 
together show <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia" target="_blank" data-omtr-intcmp="lb_russian-forces-attacking-kyiv,-explosions-heard-in-ukrainian-capital:-live-updates_postclickthru_28_article1 ">Russia</a> that it is isolated and alone in its aggressive actions.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Let
 us show Russia that every other U.N. member state believes that it is 
time to de-escalate, to come back to the negotiating table and to work 
toward peace, so <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine" target="_blank" data-omtr-intcmp="lb_russian-forces-attacking-kyiv,-explosions-heard-in-ukrainian-capital:-live-updates_postclickthru_28_article2 ">Ukrainians</a> can live in security and the tenets of the U.N. charter can be upheld for future generations to come,” she added.&nbsp;</p><p>
Thomas-Greenfield also said a larger military conflict in Ukraine could 
create a massive refugee crisis "with as many as five million more 
people displaced by Russia's war of choice and putting pressure on 
Ukraine's neighbors."</p></div><div class="meta meta-lower"><span class="author">Posted by Greg Norman </span><a href="#" class="share">Share</a></div></article><article class="article-item" id="post-27" data-post-id=""><div class="meta meta-upper"><time class="time" datetime="Wed Feb 23 2022 11:40:04 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)"></time><h2 class="title">US ambassador warns UN members from giving Russia ‘a pass’ on Ukraine</h2></div><div class="content"><p>U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.

 is no middle ground here,” she said. “Calling for both sides to

“President Putin gave us the clearest indication of his intentions on 
Monday when he asked the world to travel back in time by more than a 100
 years before the United Nations even existed to an age of empires,” 
Thomas-Greenfield continued. “He asserted that Russia can recolonize its
 neighbors and that he will use force to make a farce of the United 
Nations.

 Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has told the United Nations Wednesday in
 New York that “we are at a critical juncture in world history and our 
actions today define it for decades to come.”&nbsp;</p><p>
Kuleba says his country’s some 40 million residents “only wish to live 
in peace and prosperity, not in fear, intimidation – not under <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia" target="_blank" data-omtr-intcmp="lb_russian-forces-attacking-kyiv,-explosions-heard-in-ukrainian-capital:-live-updates_postclickthru_24_article2 ">Russian</a> fire, bombs and shelling.”&nbsp;</p><p>“We
 are currently in the middle of the largest security crisis in Europe 
since the second world war,” he continued. “This crisis was created and 
is being escalated by one side unilaterally – by the Russian 
Federation.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Russia’s accusations of Ukraine are absurd, 
Ukraine has never threatened or attacked anyone,” Kuleba also said. 
“Ukraine has never planned and does not plan any such action. Ukraine 
has never planned and does not plan any military offensive in the Donbas
 [region], neither any provocations or acts of sabotage.”&nbsp;</p><p>
“It is ultimately absurd to suggest that Ukraine could have prepared or 
anything like this and waited for months until Russia amassed an 
enormous military force along our borders to proceed with such plans," 
he added. "This absurdity defies basic logic.”&nbsp;</p></div><div class="meta meta-lower"><span class="author">Posted by Greg Norman </span><a href="#" class="share">Share</a></div></article><article class="article-item" id="post-23" data-post-id=""><div class="meta meta-upper"><time class="time" datetime="Wed Feb 23 2022 10:32:47 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)"></time><h2 class="title">Ukraine confirms new 'mass DDoS attack on state websites in Ukraine'</h2></div><div class="content"><p>Mykhailo

 S&amp;P 500 entered correction territory Tuesday, down 10% from its

sanctions on Russia. For the year, it's down over 9%.&nbsp;</p><p>In a 
note this week, Goldman economist Dominic Wilson said the S&amp;P 500

"outright conflict" breaks out. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, 
meanwhile, could plunge 9.6%. The benchmark is already off over 14% this
 year.&nbsp;</p><p>
"Although Russia/Ukraine tensions appeared to affect primarily local 
assets in January, spillovers to global assets have been much more 
obvious in February," the analyst note said. "If risks flare up further,
 and we shift to an outright conflict scenario coupled with punitive 
sanctions, the build in political risk premium would very likely 
extend."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/stock-market-tumble-ukraine-russia-crisis" target="_blank">Click here</a> to read more on Fox Business.</p></div><div class="meta meta-lower"><span class="author">Posted by Megan Henney </span><a href="#" class="share">Share</a></div></article><article class="article-item" id="post-14" data-post-id=""><div class="meta meta-upper"><time class="time" datetime="Wed Feb 23 2022 07:08:40 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)"></time><h2 class="title">Ukrainian resident provides assistance to 200 families</h2></div><div class="content"><p></p><div class="post-video-container" data-video-id="6298587833001"></div><p></p><p>Hatzalah Ukraine CEO Shlomo Rosilio says that large nations need to abide by their agreements and commitment to protect <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine" target="_blank" data-omtr-intcmp="lb_russian-forces-attacking-kyiv,-explosions-heard-in-ukrainian-capital:-live-updates_postclickthru_14_article1 ">Ukraine</a>.</p></div><div class="meta meta-lower"><span class="author">Posted by Fox News </span><a href="#" class="share">Share</a></div></article><div class="ad-container desktop ad-h-50 ad-w-300"><div class="ad gam" id="desk-ad-lb50"></div><script>window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike){

Washington Post reported.</p><p>“This situation echoes our history,” he 
told the U.N. Security Council in the viral speech. “Kenya and almost 
every African country was birthed by the ending of empire. Our borders 
were not of our own drawing. They were drawn in the distant colonial 
metropoles of London, Paris and Lisbon, with no regard for the ancient
