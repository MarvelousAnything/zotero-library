Russian President Vladimir Putin initially expected to take control of Ukraine's capital within two days of the invasion, U.S. intelligence believes Kyiv is in a position to hold the Russians at bay for several more weeks, a U.S. official said Thursday.\n\nThe official said Russian forces are capable of circling Kyiv in the next week or two but that the battle to take the capital is expected to take much longer than that. The official said the U.S. assessment, which is fluid and changes often, is that the fight for control of the city could take four to six weeks.   \n\nThe official said Ukraine is using a layered, mobile defense — quick hit-and-run strikes using light infantry and portable anti-armor weapons. The Ukrainian military is fighting on its home turf and using the local population as its eyes and ears, so its intelligence and mobility have been better than the Russians'.\n\nThe officials said the Russians still have the overwhelming force superiority but that they are not using it effectively or operating in a coordinated way, as a large military could. In the meantime, the Ukrainian military has put up a tough fight.

We need to get this aircraft immediately to the people of Ukraine,\" he said.","description":"Romney: 'Makes no sense' to keep Soviet jets from going to Ukraine"},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"NBC News","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/site-images/nbcnews-logo-white.png","width":166,"height":24}},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/ukraine-russia-war-live-updates-top-diplomats-meet-talks-kyiv-n1291419#ncrd1291521"},"headline":"U.S. intel officials discuss Russian capabilities at Senate worldwide threats hearing","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/ukraine-russia-war-live-updates-top-diplomats-meet-talks-kyiv-n1291419#ncrd1291521","datePublished":"2022-03-10T17:13:56.000Z","dateModified":"2022-03-10T17:13:56.000Z","author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Organization","name":"NBC Universal","@id":"https://www.nbcuniversal.com/"}],"image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_10/3539980/afp_324t6mf.jpg","articleBody":"","description":"U.S. intel officials discuss Russian capabilities at Senate worldwide threats hearing"},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"NBC News","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/site-images/nbcnews-logo-white.png","width":166,"height":24}},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/ukraine-russia-war-live-updates-top-diplomats-meet-talks-kyiv-n1291419#ncrd1291511"},"headline":"Mariupol residents grow desperate as food, other essentials run low, Red Cross official says ","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/ukraine-russia-war-live-updates-top-diplomats-meet-talks-kyiv-n1291419#ncrd1291511","datePublished":"2022-03-10T16:28:00.000Z","dateModified":"2022-03-10T22:09:08.000Z","author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Zoë Richards","image":null,"jobTitle":null,"description":"Zoë is the evening politics reporter for NBC News."}],"image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_10/3539980/afp_324t6mf.jpg","articleBody":"Residents of the besieged port city of Mariupol are running low on basic necessities, the International Committee of the Red Cross said Thursday, describing the situation as \"increasingly dire and desperate.\"\n\nFood, water, heat, electricity and medical care supplies are scant among the city's approximately 400,000 residents, the organization said, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine stretched into its third week. \n\nSasha Volkov, the head of the humanitarian agency's delegation in Mariupol, detailed dwindling resources and said diabetes and cancer patients were not able to get much-needed medications in an audio message recorded on Wednesday and shared by the Red Cross.\n\n“Many have no water at all for drinking,” he said. “Some people still have food, but I’m not sure for how long it will last.” \n\nVolkov said the siege has left families desperate for relief.\n\n“People started to attack each other for food,” he said."},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"NBC News","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/site-images/nbcnews-logo-white.png","width":166,"height":24}},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/ukraine-russia-war-live-updates-top-diplomats-meet-talks-kyiv-n1291419#ncrd1291510"},"headline":"As millions flee Ukraine, some countries take in far more refugees than others","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/ukraine-russia-war-live-updates-top-diplomats-meet-talks-kyiv-n1291419#ncrd1291510","datePublished":"2022-03-10T16:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2022-03-10T23:00:06.000Z","author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Chantal Da Silva","image":null,"jobTitle":null,"description":"Chantal Da Silva is a breaking news editor for NBC News Digital based in London. "}],"image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_10/3539980/afp_324t6mf.jpg","articleBody":"LONDON — More than 2 million people had fled Ukraine as of Wednesday in what could soon become Europe’s biggest refugee crisis of the 21st century and the worst since World War II.

of its rules allowing Ukrainians to obtain British visas after facing widespread backlash over its response to the growing refugee crisis. \n\nSpeaking in Parliament on Thursday, British Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that the U.K. would be rolling out a streamlined online visa application system for Ukrainians seeking to flee the war with Russia. \n\nPatel told members of Parliament the changes in response to \"Putin's depraved war\" would come into effect starting Tuesday.\n\nShe said the move would allow visa application centers across Europe to focus their efforts on assisting Ukrainians without passports, in order to speed up the process. \n\nThe decision comes after the British government faced criticism with France accusing the U.K. of turning away Ukrainians and telling them to travel to visa application centers in France to apply to enter. Patel denied the accusations earlier this week.\n\nThe U.K. has also faced condemnation, however, for only issuing visas to several hundred Ukrainians and for only issuing the visas under a limited program for those with relatives in Britain. \n\nMeanwhile, neighboring countries around Ukraine have accepted tens of thousands of refugees fleeing the conflict, with Poland taking in more than 1.4 million, according to the latest data from the United Nations refugee agency.","description":"The U.K. has announced an

 of the invasion, U.S. intelligence believes Kyiv is in a position to

Thursday.</p><p class="">The official said Russian forces are capable of
 circling Kyiv in the next week or two but that the battle to take the

 U.S. assessment, which is fluid and changes often, is that the fight 
for control of the city could take four to six weeks.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="">The
 official said&nbsp;Ukraine is using a layered, mobile defense 
—&nbsp;quick hit-and-run strikes using light infantry and portable 
anti-armor weapons. The Ukrainian military is fighting on its home turf 
and using the local population as its eyes and ears, so its intelligence
 and mobility have been better than the Russians'.</p><p class="">The 
officials said the Russians still have the overwhelming force 
superiority but that they are not using it effectively or operating in a
 coordinated way, as a large military could. In the meantime, the 
Ukrainian military has put up a tough fight. The official said the U.S. 
believes that Russia has lost hundreds of vehicles, along with 15 to

civilian population. Still,&nbsp;Ukrainian authorities were able to

 museums in Milan will return several works of art on loan from Russia 
after requests for their early return, the Italian galleries said on 
Thursday, a further sign of broader tensions caused by the invasion of 
Ukraine.</p><p class="">The Hermitage Museum, based in St. Petersburg, 
wrote to Milan's Palazzo Reale asking for the return of two 
paintings&nbsp;— including "Young woman with a feathered hat" by the 
Venetian painter Titian&nbsp;— loaned for the "Titian and the image of 
women in 16th century Venice" exhibition.</p><p class="">"I think the 
two works will be picked up by the end of March," said museum director 
Domenico Piraina, adding they cannot oppose the request.</p><p class="">"Titian's work is certainly important but the exhibition can go ahead well without it," he said.</p><p class="">The exhibition started on Feb. 23 and will run until June 5.</p><p class="">"When
 I read the letter I felt bitter because culture should be protected 
from war but these are difficult times," Piraina added.</p><p class="">Gallerie
 d'Italia, which operates another museum in Milan, said it received a 
request for the return of 23 works out of nearly 200 in the current 
exhibition "Grand Tour. Dream of Italy from Venice to Pompeii," on loan 
from three Russian museums.</p><p class="">"They will be returned before
 the exhibition closes on 27 March," said a spokesperson for the Intesa 
Sanpaolo bank which owns the collection at the gallery and two other 
sites in Naples and Vicenza.</p><p class="">The Rome-based Fendi Foundation and another museum in northern city of Udine have received similar requests.&nbsp;</p><div class="df justify-start mt6 lh-none share-list dn-print"><input class="dn" id="social-menu-toggle--9782" tabindex="-1" checked="checked" type="checkbox"><ul class="share-list__social-list js-social-share"><li class="share-list__social-list-text founders-mono">Share this -</li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Fukraine-russia-war-live-updates-top-diplomats-meet-talks-kyiv-n1291419%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1291475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-facebook share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon social-share-list__icon--twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Italian%20museums%20to%20return%20loaned%20works%20to%20Russian%20galleries&amp;via=NBCNews&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Fukraine-russia-war-live-updates-top-diplomats-meet-talks-kyiv-n1291419%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1291475&amp;original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Fukraine-russia-war-live-updates-top-diplomats-meet-talks-kyiv-n1291419%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1291475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-twitter share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon"><a href="mailto:?subject=Italian%20museums%20to%20return%20loaned%20works%20to%20Russian%20galleries&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Fukraine-russia-war-live-updates-top-diplomats-meet-talks-kyiv-n1291419%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1291475"><span class="icon icon-email share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="live-blog-card article-body__content w-100 mh0 mb8 fn overflow-x-hidden" id="ncrd1291468"><div class="live-blog-card__stripes"></div><h2 class="styles_cardTitle__OnwNs">Zelenskyy says more than 60,000 residents 'rescued' from besieged cities Wednesday</h2><div class="card-byline mb5 df"><span class="byline-thumbnail byline-thumbnail--no-image"></span><div class="df flex-column"><p class="f4 founders-cond mv0 gray-80"><span class="byline-name">Chantal Da Silva</span></p><div class="timestamps founders-mono f2">10h ago / 1:04 PM UTC</div></div></div><p class="">More

 to obtain British visas after facing widespread backlash over its 
response to the growing refugee crisis.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Speaking in<a href="https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/c27165e6-051e-4cb9-8f07-a4ec24bdaa4f" target="_blank">&nbsp;Parliament on Thursday</a>,
 British Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that the U.K. would be 
rolling out a streamlined online visa application system for Ukrainians 
seeking to flee the war with Russia.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Patel told members of Parliament the changes in response to "Putin's depraved war" would come into effect starting Tuesday.</p><p class="">She
 said the move would allow visa application centers across Europe to 
focus their efforts on assisting Ukrainians without passports, in order 
to speed up the process.&nbsp;</p><p class="">The decision comes after the British government <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/2-million-flee-ukraine-nations-face-scrutiny-response-refugee-crisis-rcna17920" target="_blank">faced criticism</a>&nbsp;with
 France accusing the U.K. of turning away Ukrainians and telling them to
 travel to visa application centers in France to apply to 
enter.&nbsp;Patel denied the accusations earlier this week.</p><p class="">The
 U.K. has also faced condemnation, however, for only issuing visas to 
several hundred Ukrainians and for only issuing the visas under a 
limited program for those with relatives in Britain.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Meanwhile,
 neighboring countries around Ukraine have accepted tens of thousands of
 refugees fleeing the conflict, with Poland taking in more than 1.4 
million, according to the<a href="https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine" target="_blank"> latest data</a> from the United Nations refugee agency.</p><div class="df justify-start mt6 lh-none
