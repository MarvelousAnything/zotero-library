Singapore has outlined details of the financial measures it will impose on Russia , after it announced on Monday that it would take the rare step of imposing sanctions.

In a statement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said:

    We will impose financial measures targeted at designated Russian banks, entities and activities in Russia, and fund-raising activities benefiting the Russian government. Digital payment token service providers are specifically prohibited from facilitating transactions that could help to circumvent these financial measures. These measures apply to all financial institutions in Singapore, including banks, finance companies, insurers, capital markets intermediaries, securities exchanges and payment service providers.

The statement describes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “a gross violation of international law”. It is the first country in Southeast Asia to impose sanctions.

Full details of the measures are on the ministry website .

The port city Mariupol has been “blockaded” by Russian forces, according to its mayor, AFP reports.

Mayor Vadym Boychenko has perviously warned the city has no water, heat or electricity and that supplies of food are running out. He has asked for military assistance and for a humanitarian corridor to allow the safe evacuation of some of the city’s 400,000 residents.

If Russia were to control the city, this would help it to build a land corridor between Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, and Russian-backed regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.

In a message posted to the mayor’s Telegram account, he said:

    For now, we are looking for solutions to humanitarian problems and all possible ways to get Mariupol out of the blockade...

    Our priority is the establishment of a ceasefire so that we can restore vital infrastructure and set up a humanitarian corridor to bring food and medicine into the city.

Hello, Rebecca Ratcliffe here in Bangkok, taking over from my colleague Dani.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will address the US Senate on Saturday during a Zoom call that is scheduled for 9.30am Eastern Time. The call has been requested by Zelenskiy.

Here is AFP’s report

    As the war in Ukraine intensifies, some US lawmakers are urging President Joe Biden to take a tougher stance against Russia, such as by suspending imports of its oil.

    The White House has ruled this out so far, fearing it might cause rising oil prices to go up even more and hurt US consumers stung by record inflation.

    Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has called for “somebody in Russia” to assassinate President Vladimir Putin.

    Zelensky himself is strongly urging NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to halt bombing raids but the Biden administration has ruled this out, fearing it might lead to an all-out war between the West and Russia , although some US lawmakers support the creation of such a zone.

Zelenskiy says Nato has given “green light for further bombing of Ukraine" by ruling out no-fly zone

Volodymyr Zelenskiy has critisized Nato for refusing to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine , saying the decision has given “the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian towns and villages”.

“All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity,” the Ukrainian president said in an emotional nighttime address.

Nato warned on Friday that imposing a no-fly zone could provoke full-fledged war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia. “The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send Nato fighter planes into Ukraine’s airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,” Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato chief, said. “If we did that, we’ll end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe , involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering.”

Zelenskiy said Nato countries have created a narrative that a no-fly zone would provoke Russia’s aggression against Nato. “This is the self-hypnosis of those who are weak, insecure inside, despite the fact they possess weapons many times stronger than we have,” he said.

He also praised Ukrainians for their resistance against Russia’s invasion: “We are warriors of light,” he said. “The history of Europe will remember this forever.”

The war in Ukraine is shaking markets, slowing economic growth and sending European stocks sinking.

From Reuters :

Data showing a vibrant U.S. jobs market strengthened the dollar and spurred commodity prices higher, but the war in Ukraine overshadowed the blowout report as the euro plunged on the worsening outlook for slower European economic growth.

The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.8% as job growth surged in February, a bright spot for an economy that faces mounting headwinds from rising inflation, tighter monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and geopolitical tensions.

The euro tumbled below $1.10 for the first time in almost two years and hit a fresh seven-year low against the safe-haven Swiss franc as Russian forces seized the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and fighting raged elsewhere in Ukraine.

European stocks sank to near one-year lows, with the pan-regional STOXX 600 index sliding 3.56% to increase losses for the week to 7% - its worst weekly decline since the depths of a pandemic-fueled sell-off in March 2020.

The Metropolitan police’s war crimes team is assisting in the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation of alleged war crimes in Ukraine .

The Met is tasked with carrying out “any UK enquiries into war crimes and core international crimes”, it said Friday, and is “appealing for anyone in the UK who may have direct evidence of war crimes”.

“Officers are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may themselves have witnessed or been the victim of any war crimes in Ukraine at any time from 21 November 2013 onwards,” the Met said.

Investigators are seeking out people who have a direct link to relevant information, rather than the general public submitting social media posts or media reports.

“This could be in the form of direct messages, images or videos that friends or relatives here in the UK have been sent by those in Ukraine. Or it could be somebody who was previously in Ukraine and who may have witnessed or even been a victim of a war crime and has since travelled to the UK,” said Richard Smith, the head of the Met’s counter terrorism command.
