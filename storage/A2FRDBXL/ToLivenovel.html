 summer sojourn among Chinese rural peasants, wandering from village 
 to village, watching the girls, talking with the men (3), learning "<i>all 
 those dirty stories and sad songs from them"</i> (4).&nbsp; <i>"That 
 summer I almost fell in love</i>. . . . [with] <i>an enchanting 
 young girl,"</i> sixteen or seventeen years old, who was embarrassed 
 by the unnamed narrator's attentions (5).&nbsp; One scorching hot 
 and blissful afternoon, he "<i>spoke endlessly and irresponsibly of 
 my plans to take her away to see the world</i>," never stopping "<i>to 
 think about tomorrow</i>" (5).&nbsp; But this romantic love idyll 
 ends when he is approached by the maiden's three burley brothers: 
 the unnamed narrator, who has no serious marriage intentions, is 
 scared off (5).&nbsp;
 <p><b><i>"It was just as summer arrived </i></b>

 afternoon </b>(6).&nbsp; Awakening from a dream two hours later, the 
 unnamed narrator sees "<b><i>an old man in one of the nearby fields 
 patiently trying to coax an old ox into working"</i></b> (6).&nbsp; 
 The old man <b>Fugui </b>brightly cajols his weary old ox into 
 plowing the field, reciting proverbs, singing lines of verse, 
 calling the old ox by many different names: <b>Erxi, Youzing, 
 Jiazhen, Fengxia, Kugen</b> (6-7).&nbsp; The unnamed narrator's 
 curiosity is piqued and he engages the old man Fugui in conversation 
 (7-8).&nbsp; Cagey in responding to the young man's questions, <b>
 the old man Fugui explains that the old ox's name is also Fugui,</b> 
 but calling the ox many names fools his old friend into thinking 
 there are "other oxen around working the fields" so the ox will "<i>work

 is the passionate telling of one man’s life, family and country. 
 The original novel and the film adaptation follow this man, Xu 
 Fugui, from a young and impetuous father to a much older and wiser 
 grandfather. Though there is much in common with the two tellings 
 there are also some dramatic differences. The book evokes more 
 passion while the film brings anger. In the novel we see the 
 inside of Fugui, what he is thinking, feeling and how that turns 
 into action. We see his family’s struggle against the land and 
 personal, continual loss. The film is also wrenching, but from a 
 different perspective, that of an insider as the communist 
 movement takes over. The film can be infuriating as you see these 
 people yanked around by various ideals and governments, still

 <font face=Arial size=2>"The novel <u>To Live </u>by Yu Hua is 
 a story about the struggles of the Xu family through forty years 
 of life in China as it evolves from World War 2 through the

 Communist China.&nbsp; This is primarily a narration by our main 
 character Fugui, who, along with his wife Jiazhen, represent the 
 second of four generations of the Xu's.&nbsp; What is hauntingly 
 clear is not just the remarkable character development of Fugui, 
 but his strength and humility in the face of overwhelming 
 obstacles manifested by the communist structure, starvation, the 
 death of his children, and the overall unfairness of life.&nbsp;

 in these same fields</font></b><font size=2> (8):&nbsp; Fugui 
 recalls <b>his father</b> walking these same fields as their owner, 
 and hailed by field workers as "Master" (9). Then Fugui's father had 
 "very high social status," though "every time he squatted down to 
 take a shit he was just like a poor man"; indeed, like common farm 
 animals, the Xu family patriarch belched and preferred to relieve 
 himself "out in the open"&nbsp; in "the manure vat" (9).&nbsp; <br>
 </font><b><font size=2> [ca. 1945?]:</font></b><font size=2>
 <b>Fugui's father - at age sixty</b> - continued this practice, and Fugui's daughter <b>Fengxia - at age three 
 or four</b> - would run out "to watch grandpa taking a shit" (9). At 
 that time, the Xu family still owned "over a hundred <i>mu</i>* of 
 land" (10), father and son revered as wealthy land owners. <b><br>
 [ca. 1940?] </b>The son, Fugui had married <b>Jiazhen</b>, daughter 
 of a rich rice merchant in town: "A wealthy woman marries a wealthy 
 man - it's like piling all the money up," but <b>it's been</b> [at

 early on, his teachers had warned his father that Fugui would "be 
 nothing but trouble,"&nbsp; "a rotten piece of wood that could not 
 be carved," and, in retrospect, old Fugui admits that these 
 predictions were right (10). When he was young, privileged Fugui was 
 arrogant, illustrated by stories of being carried on the back of <b>
 Changgen</b>, a Xu family servant; of whoring and gambling, and of 
 neglecting filial duties to Xu family ancestors (11). His father 
 repeatedly berates his son Fugui for his dissolute habits, but Fugui 
 learns from his mother that his father was a hypocrite: ". . . when 
 my dad was young he'd been just like me," so "Why should I listen to 
 him?" (12).&nbsp; </font></p>

 <span style=font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%>"In the film, 
 Fugui settles in the city. The city reflects all of the political 
 struggling and the rise of communism. In the city we see the Xu 
 family always cautious of what they say, whom they speak with or how 
 they are viewed. In the city, Fugui wants it to be clear that he is 
 a Mao supporter. Seeing Fugui’s life in the city is more of a 
 propaganda film, watching as the Chinese people are taken over by 
 forces larger than they are. In the novel, upon Fugui’s release from 
 the army the family continues to live in their thatched hut. The 
 Communist Party gives Fugui the same land to work and contribute 
 from and the family survives in relative peace for several years. It 
 appears they will have all the food they need in the communal meal 
 house, but as easily as it came the supplies run out and the family 
 is again forced to scavenge for nourishment" (<a href=#Elliott>Elliott</a>).</span></font></p></td>

 should they give Fengxia away to a good family that can afford to 
 give her a better life, and thereby be able to save the money needed 
 to send Youqing to school? (88).&nbsp; Though smart, Fengxia is deaf 
 and mute and the only family that will take her is only concerned 
 about how hard she will work (88, 89).&nbsp; Everyone is devastated 
 when Fengxia is given away, particularly Youqing (90-93). <b>&nbsp;<br>
 Two months later</b> when it is time for Youqing to start school, he 
 refuses to go until Fugui beats him (93-94). When things start off 
 badly for Youqing at school, Fugui beats him some more (94-95).&nbsp;
 <br>
 "<b>A few months after Fengxia is taken away, she came running back</b> 
 . . . in the middle of the night" (95). Youqing is overjoyed to have 
 his sister back home, but the next evening after dinner, Fugui takes 
 Fengxia back to town, but finally cannot bring himself to leave his

 early before school and returning during mid-day break, to cut grass 
 and feed their two lambs - which always threatened to make him late 
 for classes and required that he always run back and forth between 
 home and school (98-99). To ease the hardship on his worn out mother 
 always making him new shoes to replace the ones he wore out running, 
 Youqing would run barefoot (99-100).&nbsp; </font></p>

 Xu's five <i>mu</i> of land go to the newly established <b>people's 
 communes </b>(100). This new movement toward communism means the 
 village head is now called the "team leader," all families work the 
 collective fields, even cooking pots must be turned over to "smelt 
 iron," everyone is to be fed in the "communal dining hall," and all 
 private stores of food and livestock turned over to the 
 commune--including Youqing's lambs (100-102).&nbsp; At first 
 everyone is happy and people enjoy meat in their meals, but the Xu 
 family narrowly misses having their house taken when the "<i>fengshui
 </i>expert" scouts out the the most fortuitous location for the 
 village commune's iron smelting cauldron (103-106; on <b><i>Fengshui</i></b>, 
 see note p. 105). Fugui and Jianzen decide it is "<b>fate</b>" 
 (108).&nbsp; No one knows how to smelt iron: It is young Youqing's 
 bright, but bad, idea that water should be added to the smelting pot 
 (109-110).&nbsp; </font></p>
 <p align=left><font face=Arial size=2>During this period, <b>
 Jiazhen gets sick; <i>after two months </i></b>of unsuccessfully 
 trying to smelt iron, it is Fugui's turn to watch the smelting fire 
 and add water: that night Fugui falls asleep and doesn't add water, 
 and Youqing's lambs are slaughtered (111-116). The next day, 
 seriously concerned about his ailing wife, Fugui takes Jiazhen into 
 town to a doctor, who diagnoses her with an incurable "soft bone 
 disease" [rickets: see note, p. 117).&nbsp; When they return to the 
 village, Fugui discovers his "mistake" of not adding water to the 
 cauldron, has finally enabled the iron to be smelted so that Taiwan 
 can be bombed(118); but Youqing is weeping inconsolably about the 
 slaughter of his lambs (119).&nbsp; Food runs out, and villagers are 
 told they must now buy pots and do their own cooking; fortunately 
 the harvest is due in a month (120).&nbsp; The new system of <b>work 
 points </b>(120-121) devastates Jiazhen, who cannot do her share of 
 the work, which falls to her strong daughter Fengxia (122).</font></p>
 <p align=center><font face=Arial size=2 color=#800000><b><i>
 [We've nearly caught up to the time period when this installment of 
 Fugui's story began on p. 87]: </i></b></font></p>
 <p align=left><font face=Arial size=2><b>Youqing is now twelve 
 years old, and wants to quit school to help his family at home </b>
 (122-123). Trying to be kind, Fugui goes to town to sell firewood in 
 order to buy his son some candy, but then becomes furious when he 
 sees that Youqing is not studying in school, hits his son, makes a 
 scene before the school, and causes his son "lose face" (123-125).&nbsp;
 <b>For over a month after that incident</b>, Youqing snubs his 
 father (125-126).&nbsp; Contrite, Fugui makes peace by buying his 
 son another lamb, and Youqing goes back to running back and forth 
 between town school and feeding the lamb twice a day (126-127).&nbsp;
 <br>
 <b>Youqing is in fourth grade when a town-wide athletic meet is held
 </b>(128).&nbsp; To Fugui's surprise, Youqing beats everyone in the 
 footrace, is genuinely bright-faced and happy, and his gym teacher 
 rewards him with candy (129-130). THe gym teacher visits the Xu's at 
 home and praises Youqing lavishly, but Fugui dampens his son's joy 
 by reminded him that excellence in running is hardly why Youqing is 
 being sent to school (130-131). <br>
 <i><b>That same year</b></i>, before the rice can ripen, it rains 
 hard for a month; then a heat wave rots all the rice and <b>the 
 harvest is ruined</b> (131-132).&nbsp; <i><b>Two months</b></i> of 
 near starvation means Youqing's lamb must be sold (132-133).&nbsp; 
 Youqing is more adult and resigned this time, and Fugui assures him 
 that it is lambs', animals' "<b>fate</b>" (134).&nbsp; In town, 
 Fugui gets much less for the lamb than he had hoped - only forty <i>
 jin </i>of rice, which l<b><i>asts less than three months </i></b>
 (134-137).&nbsp; Everyone is starving and an incident when a 
 villager tries to claim a rare sweet potato that Fengxia has dug up 
 erupts in a violent fight between Fugui and Xang Si (138-141).&nbsp; 
 Things are so bad that frail <b>Jiazhen</b> makes a painful 
 pilgrimage into town to beg food from her father and returns home 
 with a small bag of precious rice (142-143).&nbsp; But the smell of 
 cooking rice draws many hungry villagers, which the Team Leader 
 finally drives off, but for a price (144-145).&nbsp; This desperate 
 situation continues until the next rice harvest, which once again 
 supplies everyone with some grain (146).<br>
 <b>Jiazhen becomes bedridden</b>, spends her time unraveling all her 
 own clothes to make new ones for her children (147).&nbsp; Jiazhen 
 begins discussing her funeral wishes with Fugui, and asks him to 
 find Fengxia a husband (148). </font></p>
 <p align=left><font face=Arial size=2><b>"That year Youqing 
 was in the fifth grade.&nbsp; There is a common saying that 
 'Calamities never come singly.' . . . How could I have known that 
 just as Jiazhen was starting to feel better, something would happen 
 to Youqing?"</b> (149).<br>
 The principal of Youqing's school, wife of the county magistrate, 
 loses a lot of blood giving birth in the city hospital, so teachers 
 at Youqing's school called on all the fifth graders to donate blood, 
 and Youqing is first in line to give blood (149). Youqing is the 
 first of the students to have the right blood type, but "the people 
 in the hospital wouldn't stop taking Youqing's blood--they just kept 
 extracting more and more" until they extracted "almost every drop of 
 blood in my son's body" (150-151).&nbsp; A school child arrives in 
 the country to find Fugui and take him into town to the hospital, 
 and when he arrives, Youqing is dead (151-153).&nbsp; Weeping in 
 disbelief, Fugui grows murderous, and finally confronts <b>County 
 Magistrate Liu </b>- who turns out to be his old war comrade, <b>
 Chungsheng </b>(155).&nbsp; Surprised, his anger quelled, Fugui and 
 Chungsheng catch up on old times, but then Fugui's sorrow and 
 despair returns (156).&nbsp; He carries his dead son home and buries 
 him (156-158), but keeps the news from Jiazhen and Fengxia for 
 several days, spending his nights in devastated vigil beside 
 Youqing's grave (159-160).&nbsp; Without being told, Jiazhen knows 
 that her son is dead and Fugui carries her to visit her son's grave, 
 a scene of excruciating sorrow and beauty (160-161).</font></p>

 [novel] is, by no means an endorsement of communism.&nbsp; One of 
 the great things about historical fiction is that one gets an 
 education about the history of a particular place and culture in the 
 context of a story.&nbsp; In "<b>The Great Proletarian Cultural 
 Revolution (1966-1976): A Basic Outline of Events</b>" by <b>Eileen
 <a href=#Chow>Chow</a></b>, one gets a great snapshot of the 
 progression of Chinese communism.&nbsp; There are many events in the 
 book and move that parallel actual events or situations.&nbsp; One 
 such situation that comes to mind is the Red Brigade moving out into 
 the countryside to instruct the working class.&nbsp; Another is the 
 young Red Brigade student 'doctors' replacing the 'intellectuals' 
 (actual doctors).&nbsp; This sort of madness was commonplace during 
 the Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976.&nbsp; In the movie 
 Fengxia loses her life to one such group of 'doctors' who did not 
 know how to stop her bleeding during childbirth.&nbsp; It is fair to 
 say that however noble . . . our Fugui and Jiazhen were, they were 
 only more so because of the decrepit, backward, violent, unworkable 
 and unfair system of communism.&nbsp; The novel and especially the 
 movie show this convincingly" (<b><a href=#Hage>Hage</a></b>).</font></font></p></td>

 (227): Rain is forecast, which would ruin Fugui's cotton crop, so

 (227-228). Fugui realizes his grandson Kugen, now burning up with 
 fever, is really sick; picks fresh beans to make Kugen a special 
 meal, then leaves him to eat it and returns to harvesting his cotton 
 crop (228-229).&nbsp; Returning at dusk, Fugui finds Kugen's little

 and stupidity," old Fugui declares, "that killed Kugen" (230).</font></p>
 <p><font size=2 face=Arial>"From then on I had to get by alone," 
 and Fugui did not expect to live much longer - but he does live on (230-231).&nbsp; 
 "It seems this life of mine will be over soon.&nbsp; It's been an 
 ordinary life" (231).&nbsp; But Fugui, the survivor who has outlived 
 so many others, including <b>Long Er </b>and <b>Chungsheng </b>who 
 "each had their day in the sun, but in the end . . . lost their

 savings and heads for the town of "<b>Xinfeng,</b> where there's a big animal 
 market" (231-232). At a nearby village, Fugui happens upon an old 
 ox, tears streaming from the ox's eyes because he knows he's&nbsp; about to be butchered; Fugui is 
 moved by the old ox's plight, tries to move on, but finally must come 
 back to buy and save the old ox from slaughter (232-233).&nbsp; The 
 "smart" old ox, realizing Fugui has saved him, immediately stops 
 crying, stands up, nuzzles Fugui with affection, and readily follows 
 his new master home (233).&nbsp; Fugui observes, "Oxen have feelings 
 just like people do" (233).&nbsp; Everyone agrees that Fugui is a 
 fool to waste his money on this old ox, who probably has less than 
 three years of life left in him (233-234), but old Fugui and his old 
 ox have already outlived such predictions. <b>&nbsp;"Once the ox was 
 home he became a member of my family, so I thought it only right 
 that I give him a name" and decides to name the ox "Fugui": "He

 <b><font face=Verdana size=2>Michael Berry contrasts the different 
 endings of film and novel: ". . . the film ends with Fugui, Erxi, and 
 Kugan [Little Bun] gather around Jiazhen in bed, an image that suggests 
 the possibility of a post-Communist utopia.&nbsp; The novel, in contrast, 
 closes with Fugui prodding his ox, showing Yu Hua's version to be darker 
 and more existential, with survival an end in itself" (<a href=#Berry>Berry</a> 
 243).&nbsp; </font></b></p>

 <span style=font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 "A final difference between the novel and film would have to be the fact 
 that in the book all Fugui’s family dies, including his little grandson, 
 Kugen.&nbsp; This leaves the reader feeling pretty hopeless until you recognize 
 that the “older, wiser” Fugui has been telling the story all along. He has 
 persevered and endured and still has the capacity to work the fields 
 joking with his ox along the way. Somehow his story of sadness is also one 
 of hope. It is his life, it was his to choose and he chose to live.<i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To Live </i>is both a powerful 
 book and a powerful film. Each story could be independent of the other 
 while the common thread remains; a man named Xu Fugui" (<a href=#Elliott>Elliott</a>).</span></p>
 <p class=MsoNormal>
 <b><font face=Verdana size=2>Yu Hua has explained the life philosophy 
 of his protagonist Fugui:<br>
 "After going though much pain and hardship, Fugui is inextricably tied to 
 the experience of suffering.&nbsp; So there is really no place for ideas 
 like 'resistance' in Fugui's mind--he lives simply to live.&nbsp; In this 
 world I have never met anyone who has as much respect for life as Fugui.&nbsp; 
 Although he has more reason to die than most people, he keeps on living" (qtd. 
 in <a href=#Berry>Berry</a>&nbsp; 244).</font></b></p>
 <p class=MsoNormal>
 <b><font face=Verdana size=2>"Having grown up near hospitals and 
 operating rooms during modern China's most vicious and chaotic period, Yu 
 Hua has created a fictional reflection of this reality, a world imbued 
 with violence, death, and unspeakable cruelty.&nbsp; At the same time, his 
 world is touched by moments of poetic brilliance, a passion for life and 
 sublime beauty . . . . and now readers of English will finally be able to 
 enter that reality, in all its beauty and brutality" (<a href=#Berry>Berry</a> 
 245).</font></b></p>
 <p class=MsoNormal style=line-height:150%>
 <font face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is 
 remarkable (by American standards) is that through all the trials and 
 tribulations, too numerous to mention, Fugui and his family accepted 
 everything that came their way.&nbsp; Fugui did not complain about his lot 
 in life, perhaps because when he had an advantage early on, he wasted it.&nbsp; 
 In a way, it was his penance to carry whatever burden for however long so 
 as to provide for his family and have them by his side.&nbsp; So much of 
 what happened to the Su's was a result of the communist state but they 
 embraced it in a way that ensured their survival.&nbsp; Fugui and his 
 family never really questioned the legitimacy or fairness of Mao's Red 
 China - perhaps because it was useless to do so.. What seemed more 
 important to Fugui and Jiazhen was the immediate welfare of their family.&nbsp; 
 this idea of a successful, loving family amidst all the brutality of 
 communism struck me as strangely beautiful.&nbsp; Our author, speaking in 
 the traveler's narration (italicized) says it best: '<i>Hearing this old 
 man across from me talk like this about his wife, who had passed away over 
 ten years ago, created an almost indescribable feeling of warmth deep 
 within me.&nbsp; Like a blade of grass swaying in the wind, I caught a 
 glimpse of the movement of a distant tranquility</i>' (Hua 213) </font>
 <font face=Arial size=1>[ <a href=#NarrFrame5>Narrative Frame 5</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </font><font face=Arial size=2><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I truly doubt that there are many 
 Americans who can understand or even be moved by such profound prose.&nbsp; 
 We should all be so lucky as to experience <b><u>that</u></b> depth of 
 love and the tranquility it supports.&nbsp; It may just be that only such 
 suffering by Fugui and Jiazhen can give one the true depth of such 
 feelings.&nbsp; It may also be that modern capitalism has no time or room 
 for such tranquility.&nbsp; It certainly is true that novels like this are 
 vitally important to provide perspective in the on-going debate about what 
 is most important in life.&nbsp; Perhaps it is just 'to live'" (<b><a href=#Hage>Hage</a></b>).</font></p>
