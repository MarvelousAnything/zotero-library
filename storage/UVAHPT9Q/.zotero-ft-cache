    President of Russia

President Biden announced on Tuesday that the United States will impose new sanctions on Moscow after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into two Ukrainian territories on which the Kremlin has laid claim for years.

“This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Biden said in an address from the East Room of the White House.

Biden’s remarks came a day after Putin ordered troops into Donetsk and Luhansk under the guise of “peacekeeping,” even as the Russian president made clear that he did not accept the basic premise of Ukrainian sovereignty.

“Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belongs to his neighbors?” Biden said. “This is a flagrant violation of international law.”

The president said “there is no justification” for Putin’s aggression in the region.

“He directly attacked Ukraine’s right to exist,” Biden said.

“Russia’s moved supplies of blood and medical equipment into position on the border,” Biden added. “You don’t need blood unless you plan on starting a war.”

Biden said U.S. forces already in Europe were moving to strengthen the defenses of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, a trio of NATO allies and former Soviet republics.

“Let me be clear: These are totally defensive moves on our part,” Biden said. “We have no intention of fighting Russia. We want to send an unmistakable message, though, that the United States together with our allies will defend every inch of NATO territory and abide by the commitments we made to NATO.”

Biden said that the sanctions would target two major Russian banks, limiting their ability to finance sovereign debt. He added that the sanctions would extend to Russian elites and their family members, and made the case that since those individuals share in the country’s gains they should share in the pains as well. Biden said sanctions were coordinated with U.S. allies and would continue to escalate should Russia pursue war with Ukraine.

Earlier Tuesday, the European Union’s top diplomat said that the group’s foreign ministers had unanimously adopted sanctions against Russia. The action is likely to cause a spike in energy costs worldwide, since Europe gets 40 percent of its gas and 26 percent of its oil from its neighbor to the east. In recent days, oil prices have already risen to $100 per barrel .

“As we respond, my administration is using every tool at our disposal to protect American business and consumers from rising prices at the pump,” Biden said. “As I said last week, defending freedom will have costs for us as well and here at home. We need to be honest about that, but as we do this, I’m going to take robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy, not ours.”

The president concluded by saying he’d likely have more to say and that he was “hoping diplomacy was still available.”

    Kremlin tells United States to await response to "economic war"

    LONDON (Reuters) -The Kremlin accused the United States on Wednesday of declaring an economic war on Russia that was sowing mayhem through energy markets, and put Washington on notice it was considering its response to a ban on Russian oil and energy. Russia's economy is facing the gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West imposed heavy sanctions on almost the entire Russian financial and corporate system following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov cast the West's sanctions as a hostile act that had roiled global markets and he said it was unclear how far turbulence on global energy markets would go.

    Denmark says sorry for taking Greenland children in 1950s social experiment

    Denmark's prime minister on Wednesday delivered a face-to-face apology to six living victims of a 1950s social experiment in which 22 Greenlandic children were taken from their families and sent to Denmark to be integrated into Danish society. The Inuit children were between four and nine years old when they were shipped to Denmark, then the colonial power, in 1951 to try to re-educate them as "little Danes". The children were supposed to return to Greenland and be part of a new Danish-speaking elite that would help modernise the Arctic island's Inuit population.

    When Russian tourist Konstantin Ivanov tried to draw money from his home bank account at a cash machine on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, the transaction was blocked. Unprecedented sanctions against Russia's banks over its invasion of Ukraine are taking a toll on its citizens overseas, who have been left scrambling to find cash or turn to crypto transactions to get by. About 1,150 Russians entered Indonesia in January 2022, according to data from the statistics bureau.
