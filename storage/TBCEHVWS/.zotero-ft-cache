Feb. 6, 2022 | Kyiv, Ukraine | Participants train with wooden replicas of weapons during a defense course for civilians, hosted by National Corps, a far-right political organization.

Though tensions have escalated along the Russia-Ukraine border, many residents in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, are familiar with the anxieties of war given the long history of ongoing conflict in the region. Some locals are preparing for a Russian invasion by attending defense training sessions. Many are going about their daily lives on emptier than usual streets due to rising COVID-19 cases. Ukrainian photojournalist Oksana Parafeniuk chronicles the times. (Oksana Parafeniuk for USN&WR)
