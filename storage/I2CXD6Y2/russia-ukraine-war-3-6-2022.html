And what I mean by that is, we're going to reach a point where [Putin's] got to go into the city of Kyiv, into the built-up areas. He's probably going to have to go back to the old Soviet-style use of artillery, which will be massive, and start to take down that city. And he's going to use every weapon he has … which will include cluster-bombs to take down that city. It's a city of about 3 million. \n\nPutin does not bluff. When he said he was coming to Ukraine, he's going to go into Ukraine. And we should have been building up armaments back then. We didn't. We waited. And part of the reason we said, is because we believed if we did, it was going to be escalatory. Well, now we're too late. But if we had been reacting, let's say, six weeks ago … we could have trained up pilots [who] are current pilots in the Ukrainian Air Force on things like the A-10 and then transfer those weapons systems to … Ukraine. It doesn't take a year to train a new pilot. You're taking a pilot, putting him on a new platform, or giving him more ammunition, doing something. … Earlier on, we delayed.\n\nClick here to continue reading.","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png"},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"BlogPosting","datePublished":"2022-03-06T01:19:01-05:00","dateModified":"2022-03-07T00:28:50-05:00","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Dom Calicchio"},"headline":"Israel’s Bennett speaks with Putin, Zelenskyy separately in effort to mediate Ukraine crisis","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Fox News","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news-315x60.png","width":"315","height":"60"}},"articleBody":"[Tweet URL]\n\nTEL AVIV — Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett held talks with President Vladimir Putin Saturday in the Kremlin over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and then spoke with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, an attempt to mediate a conflict that has caused growing civilian casualties and refugees.\n\nBefore Mr. Bennett’s visit, diplomacy by President Biden and European leaders failed to stop Mr. Putin from invading Ukraine or rolling back his tanks. In the face of massive Western sanctions, Mr. Putin has found himself increasingly cut off from the world, with few avenues for diplomacy and with his country’s economy unplugged from much of global commerce.\n\nMr. Bennett’s meeting with Mr. Putin took place \"with the blessing of the U.S. administration,\" said Mr. Bennett’s office, which also noted that it coordinated with Germany and France. After seeing Mr. Putin, Mr. Bennett left Moscow for Berlin, where he met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the prime minister’s office said. Mr. Bennett was joined by Housing Minister Zeev Elkin, who was born in the now Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and assisted with the translation.\n\nClick here to continue reading this Wall Street Journal story.","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png"},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"BlogPosting","datePublished":"2022-03-06T01:19:01-05:00","dateModified":"2022-03-07T00:28:50-05:00","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Dom Calicchio"},"headline":"Putin has his 'hands full' in Ukraine, former US defense chief Robert Gates says","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Fox News","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news-315x60.png","width":"315","height":"60"}},"articleBody":"[Video ID]\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told \"One Nation with Brian Kilmeade\" on Saturday what Russian President Vladimir Putin would need to achieve to secure Ukraine and install a puppet government.\n\nROBERT GATES: He has nowhere near enough troops to put down a rebellion among millions of people in Ukraine, so he's going to have to keep a significant military force in Ukraine.

 Russian defense ministry spokesman said Sunday that any country that

itself as having “involved” in the war.&nbsp;</p><p>“We would like to 
point out that the use of the network of airfields of those countries 
for the stationing of Ukrainian combat aviation for the further use 
against the Russian Armed Forces could be viewed as the involvement of 
those countries in the armed conflict,” spokesman Igor

 agriculture minister reported over the weekend that the recent winter 
wheat harvest could be the “worst in history,” providing further 
justification to buy from Russia.</p><p>Minister of Agriculture and 
Rural Affairs Tang Renjian said rare heavy rainfall last year delayed 
the planting of about one-third the normal wheat supply, leading to a 
roughly 20% shortage in crop yield.</p><p>The war between Russia and 
Ukraine, which together produce roughly 29% of global wheat exports, had
 already pushed wheat prices to an incredible 14-year high.</p><p>
The shortage could create food security issues for China, driving it to 
buy wheat from Russia. The two countries worked out a deal on Feb. 24 
that allowed China to import wheat from all regions of Russia, which 
could provide Russia with greater funds for its war and further relief 
from devastating sanctions on its economy.</p><p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p></div><div class="meta meta-lower"><span class="author">Posted by Peter Aitken </span><a href="#" class="share">Share</a></div></article><article class="article-item is-breaking" id="post-23" data-post-id=""><div class="meta meta-upper"><span class="pill is-breaking">Breaking News</span><time class="time" datetime="Sun Mar 06 2022 09:39:50 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)"></time><h2 class="title">Ukrainian officials: Russia attacks Vinnytsia airport with 8 cruise missiles</h2></div><div class="content"><p>

 the unjustifiable Russian military aggression in independent and

sounds like a mockery of innocent Ukrainian victims," the statement 
said.</p><p>
It noted that UNESCO's 1972 convention states that cultural heritage is 
sometimes threatened by "more formidable phenomena of damage or 
destruction" compared to traditional causes of decay.</p><p>"It can be 
understand that the term 'more formidable phenomena of damage or 
destruction' includes Russian artillery shelling, bombing, and other 
forms of wartime destruction," the memorial wrote.</p><p>The memorial 
said it is requesting the meeting move to another country because it is 
"morally impossible -- without violating the spirit of the Convention --
 to hold it in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kazan, or any other Russian 
city."</p></div><div class="meta meta-lower"><span class="author">Posted by Brie Stimson </span><a href="#" class="share">Share</a></div></article><article class="article-item" id="post-11" data-post-id=""><div class="meta meta-upper"><time class="time" datetime="Sun Mar 06 2022 04:32:14 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)"></time><h2 class="title">

 Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg reflected on the Biden administration's inaction

It's pretty simple. We are heading into act II of a multi-act play. It's
 probably a Greek tragedy when you look at it. And what I mean by that 
is, we're going to reach a point where [Putin's] got to go into the city
 of Kyiv, into the built-up areas. He's probably going to have to go 
back to the old Soviet-style use of artillery, which will be massive, 
and start to take down that city. And he's going to use every weapon he 
has … which will include cluster-bombs to take down that city. It's a 
city of about 3 million.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>
Putin does not bluff. When he said he was coming to Ukraine, he's going 
to go into Ukraine. And we should have been building up armaments back 
then. We didn't. We waited. And part of the reason we said, is because 
we believed if we did, it was going to be escalatory. Well, now we're 
too late. But if we had been reacting, let's say, six weeks ago … we 
could have trained up pilots [who] are current pilots in the Ukrainian 
Air Force on things like the A-10 and then transfer those weapons 
systems to … Ukraine. It doesn't take a year to train a new pilot. 
You're taking a pilot, putting him on a new platform, or giving him more
 ammunition, doing something. … Earlier on, we delayed.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/russia-headed-kyiv-retired-lt-gen-keith-kellogg" target="_blank" data-omtr-intcmp="lb_ukraine-officials-report-attack-on-airport,-humanitarian-corridor-fails-again:-live-updates_postclickthru_7_article1 ">Click here</a> to continue reading.</p></div><div class="meta meta-lower"><span class="author">Posted by Dom Calicchio </span><a href="#" class="share">Share</a></div></article><div class="ad-container desktop ad-h-50 ad-w-300"><div class="ad gam" id="desk-ad-lb21"></div><script>window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike){

his tanks. In the face of massive Western sanctions,&nbsp;Mr. Putin has 
found himself increasingly cut off from the world, with few avenues for 
diplomacy and with his country’s economy unplugged from much of global 
commerce.</p><p>Mr. Bennett’s meeting with Mr. Putin took place "with 
the blessing of the U.S. administration," said Mr. Bennett’s office, 
which also noted that it coordinated with Germany and France. After 
seeing Mr. Putin, Mr. Bennett left Moscow for Berlin, where he met with 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the prime minister’s office said. Mr. 
Bennett was joined by Housing Minister Zeev Elkin, who was born in the 
now Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and assisted with the translation.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/israels-bennett-putin-zelenskyy-mediate-ukraine-crisis" target="_blank" data-omtr-intcmp="lb_ukraine-officials-report-attack-on-airport,-humanitarian-corridor-fails-again:-live-updates_postclickthru_6_article1 ">Click here</a> to continue reading this Wall Street Journal story.</p></div><div class="meta meta-lower"><span class="author">Posted by Dom Calicchio </span><a href="#" class="share">Share</a></div></article><article class="article-item" id="post-5" data-post-id=""><div class="meta meta-upper"><time class="time" datetime="Sun Mar 06 2022 01:41:32 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)"></time><h2 class="title">Putin has his 'hands full' in Ukraine, former US defense chief Robert Gates says</h2></div><div class="content"><p></p><div class="post-video-container" data-video-id="6299771312001"></div><p></p><p>Former
 U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told "One Nation with Brian 
Kilmeade" on Saturday what Russian President Vladimir Putin would need 
to achieve to secure&nbsp;Ukraine&nbsp;and install a puppet government.</p><p>
ROBERT GATES:&nbsp;He has nowhere near enough troops to put down a 
rebellion among millions of people in Ukraine, so he's going to have to 
keep a significant military force in Ukraine. He's probably going to 
have to increase it if he wants to hold on to that country, even if he 
imposes a puppet government, he's going to have to keep forces there to 
keep that government in power. So I think between having his hands full 
in Ukraine and the risk of a true war with NATO, I think he'll be very 
cautious about doing anything that crosses borders of NATO countries.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/robert-gate-defense-secretary-putin-russia-ukraine-biden" target="_blank" data-omtr-intcmp="lb_ukraine-officials-report-attack-on-airport,-humanitarian-corridor-fails-again:-live-updates_postclickthru_5_article1 ">Click here</a> to continue reading.</p></div><div class="meta meta-lower"><span class="author">Posted by Dom Calicchio </span><a href="#" class="share">Share</a></div></article>
