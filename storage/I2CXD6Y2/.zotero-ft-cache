KPMG International to pull out of Russia and Belarus

Professional services network KPMG announced its decision to pull out of Russia and Belarus as a result of the invasion of Ukraine.

“We believe we have a responsibility, along with other global businesses, to respond to the Russian government’s ongoing military attack on Ukraine," the firm said in a statement. "As a result, our Russia and Belarus firms will leave the KPMG network.

"KPMG has over 4,500 people in Russia and Belarus, and ending our working relationship with them, many of whom have been a part of KPMG for many decades, is incredibly difficult. This decision is not about them – it is a consequence of the actions of the Russian Government.

"We are a purpose-led and values-driven organization that believes in doing the right thing. We will seek to do all we can to ensure we provide transitional support for former colleagues impacted by this decision.”

Nikki Haley: Providing Russia with oil money is ‘absolute lunacy’

As war in Ukraine rages on, it's time the U.S. holds Russia accountable by withholding investment in Russian oil, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told "Sunday Morning Futures."

NIKKI HALEY: Stop reacting and start leading. First of all, work with Ukraine on real-time intelligence so that we can tell them everything that's happening that they can't see. Make sure that we send anti-tank, anti-air missiles immediately. Make sure that we are telling Poland and NATO that they've got to supply these planes to Ukraine. They need them right away so they can cover their own airspace. We've got to make sure we sanction these energy companies, all of them. We've got to make sure that we pull them out of the international banking system, and we need to stop taking any Russian oil. The idea that we would give our money to an enemy is unthinkable, and it's absolute lunacy. We can't allow this to continue…

Former Ukrainian President Poroshenko says Putin is 'war criminal'

Former  Ukrainian  President Petro Poroshenko on Sunday asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a "war criminal" for the "disastrous humanitarian situation" inflicted on the Ukrainian people, arguing the now 11-day conflict should be considered "a common war" as the risk to global security rises each day. 

Speaking from the ground in Kyiv, Poroshenko, who served as president of Ukraine from 2014 to 2019, described to FOX Business' "Sunday Morning Futures" the "disastrous humanitarian situation" in several Ukrainian cities, as dozens were killed overnight despite efforts to evacuate civilians. 

"We definitely proud to be the brave Ukrainian soldiers of the unity of Ukrainian people who demonstrate in and ruined all this scenario of Putin," Poroshenko said. "First, he wanted captured Ukraine for 48 hours, then in 72 hours. But today's 11th day of our fighting."

Manchin supports leaving Ukraine no-fly zone an option, banning Russian oil imports

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said Sunday he believed the option of declaring a no-fly zone above Ukraine should not be taken off the table, a move that NATO allies so far have avoided despite repeated pleas by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy due to the risk of broader conflict with Russia. 

On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a conference call with a bipartisan group of more than 280 congressional lawmakers, including Manchin.

"It was surreal to have a person on the front lines," Manchin said about the call Sunday on NBC’s "Meet The Press," basically, seeing his people being slaughtered and willing to withstand all of this and fight back and all he asks for was basically just help me, I’ll fight my own fight, just give me the tools to do it. And for us to hesitate or for anyone to hesitate in the free world is wrong. And he said that. He said if Ukraine falls, Europe may fall."

US and allies discuss Ukraine's line of succession in event Zelenskyy is captured or killed: Report

The United States and allied nations are reportedly discussing the line of succession for Ukraine government leadership in the event President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is captured or killed. 

The Ukrainian Constitution outlines that the speaker of parliament succeeds the president if anything should happen to them in office, the New York Times reported. Ruslan Stefanchuk currently serves as speaker and has been photographed with Zelenskyy and attended key virtual meetings with European leaders since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

The succession line for president beyond Stefanchuk, however, is unclear under the constitution. The country’s parliament may need to take additional steps to validate succession measures that extend beyond just top leaders, The Hill reported last month.

Eight member states signed a letter supporting an accelerated ascension process for Ukraine, which could further speed up its integration of economic and energy systems with Europe.

Russia: any country offering airfields to Ukraine will enter conflict

A Russian defense ministry spokesman said Sunday that any country that offers its airfields to Ukraine for attacks on Russia may consider itself as having “involved” in the war. 

“We would like to point out that the use of the network of airfields of those countries for the stationing of Ukrainian combat aviation for the further use against the Russian Armed Forces could be viewed as the involvement of those countries in the armed conflict,” spokesman Igor Konashenkov told Interfax news agency. 

The warning follows Ukraine’s efforts to obtain MiG fighters from neighboring countries, including NATO allies such as Poland.

Chinese official reports winter wheat harvest ‘worst in history’

China’s agriculture minister reported over the weekend that the recent winter wheat harvest could be the “worst in history,” providing further justification to buy from Russia.

Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Tang Renjian said rare heavy rainfall last year delayed the planting of about one-third the normal wheat supply, leading to a roughly 20% shortage in crop yield.

The war between Russia and Ukraine, which together produce roughly 29% of global wheat exports, had already pushed wheat prices to an incredible 14-year high.

The shortage could create food security issues for China, driving it to buy wheat from Russia. The two countries worked out a deal on Feb. 24 that allowed China to import wheat from all regions of Russia, which could provide Russia with greater funds for its war and further relief from devastating sanctions on its economy.

Ukrainian officials: Russia attacks Vinnytsia airport with 8 cruise missiles

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba reported Sunday that Russian forces attacked a civilian airport with eight cruise missiles. 

“Against our city, against our peaceful Vinnytsia which never posed a threat to Russia in any way,” Zelenskyy said in a video posted on Twitter. “A brutal, cynical missile strike has completely destroyed the airport.” 

Kuleba labelled the attack as “barbaric,” and both officials renewed their calls for a no-fly zone over Ukraine. 

The Russian Embassy in Israel pushed back on the reports by writing that the airport is “dual-purpose” and serves as a base of operations for the aviation brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Russia’s credit rating cut again, close to default

Rating agency Moody’s delivered another body-blow to Russia as it set the nation’s credit rating at its second-lowest rung, putting the country in danger of default. 

Moody's said its decision to cut Russia's rating was "driven by severe concerns around Russia's willingness and ability to pay its debt obligations". 

Russia has kept its stock market closed over fears of a sell-off, which would crater the already vulnerable economy. The ruble dropped over 20% in the past week, with $1 equal to 124 RUB. Prior to Russia’s invasion, $1 was equal to 83.53 RUB.

Humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol fails again

Russia and Ukraine once again accused each other of failing to maintain a humanitarian corridor Sunday, the second day in a row that the effort has failed. 

Russian news agency Interfax cited a Donetsk separatist official who accused Ukrainian forces of not upholding the temporary ceasefire. Ukrainian National Guard members said that pro-Russian forces encircled the port and continued to shell the area. 

The separatist official said only about 300 people of a planned 200,000 had evacuated the area, Reuters reported. 

The two countries had agreed to a temporary ceasefire Saturday to allow civilians to escape the city of Mariupol, but Ukrainian officials accused Russia of continuing to assault the city during that time. Russia in turn blamed Ukrainian nationalists of instigating the fighting.

Ukraine war: Russia's corruption is 'no doubt' affecting its military's combat performance

Historic corruption in Russia may have hit its military and eroded its ability to maintain its war efforts in Ukraine. 

Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, and the war has not unfolded the way Russian President Vladimir Putin would have wanted. The British Ministry of Defense and U.S. officials regularly note that the Russian military has made slow progress, taking several days to even address day-one targets. 

But more troubling for Russian troops would be the shortcomings in supplies and equipment: Pictures on social media indicate that troops carried rations that had expired in 2015, and the equipment appears dated, with radio communications transmitting over open channels and lacking long-range capabilities. Tanks and vehicles abandoned during combat show evidence of poor maintenance and care.

Auschwitz Memorial urges UNESCO to move upcoming session from Russia: 'Mockery of ... victims'

This Auschwitz Memorial put out a statement this weekend, urging UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) to move its upcoming World Heritage Committee session from Kaza, Russia , saying their presence would make a "mockery of innocent Ukrainian victims."

The World Heritage Committee plans to meet this June, according to its website, the memorial said.

The Auschwitz-Bikenau Nazi concentration and extermination camp is listed a UNESCO World Heritage site.

"Given the unjustifiable Russian military aggression in independent and sovereign Ukraine, planning a discussion on World Heritage in Russia sounds like a mockery of innocent Ukrainian victims," the statement said.

It noted that UNESCO's 1972 convention states that cultural heritage is sometimes threatened by "more formidable phenomena of damage or destruction" compared to traditional causes of decay.

"It can be understand that the term 'more formidable phenomena of damage or destruction' includes Russian artillery shelling, bombing, and other forms of wartime destruction," the memorial wrote.

The memorial said it is requesting the meeting move to another country because it is "morally impossible -- without violating the spirit of the Convention -- to hold it in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kazan, or any other Russian city."

Biden admin courts Venezuela as Russian economy takes hits from sanctions: report

Several senior Biden administration officials from the White House and State Department traveled to Venezuela on Saturday to meet with the Russian ally as Moscow’s economy begins to crater under the weight of sanctions, according to a report. 

The U.S. is hoping to capitalize on Russia’s economic weakness three years after the Kremlin – along with China and Iran – came to Venezuela’s financial aid when the Trump administration cut diplomatic ties with Caracas and imposed sanctions on oil exports in the Latin American country amid Western accusations of an illegitimate election, The New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. 

Most of Venezuela’s oil exports went to the U.S. before the sanctions.

The United States is considering a deal with Poland to send U.S. warplanes to Warsaw to replace any Soviet-era fighter jets the NATO country sends to Ukraine. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy – during a Saturday Zoom call with more than 280 U.S. lawmakers – said the country needs fighter jets more than the anti-aircraft missiles the U.S. had agreed to, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

Under the proposal, the Ukrainians would receive Russian-made MiGs that Poland inherited after the Cold War ended. 

But the U.S. has not signed off on the deal yet over concerns it would be seen as an escalation, a source told Fox News.

KEITH KELLOGG:  It's pretty simple. We are heading into act II of a multi-act play. It's probably a Greek tragedy when you look at it. And what I mean by that is, we're going to reach a point where [Putin's] got to go into the city of Kyiv, into the built-up areas. He's probably going to have to go back to the old Soviet-style use of artillery, which will be massive, and start to take down that city. And he's going to use every weapon he has … which will include cluster-bombs to take down that city. It's a city of about 3 million. 

Putin does not bluff. When he said he was coming to Ukraine, he's going to go into Ukraine. And we should have been building up armaments back then. We didn't. We waited. And part of the reason we said, is because we believed if we did, it was going to be escalatory. Well, now we're too late. But if we had been reacting, let's say, six weeks ago … we could have trained up pilots [who] are current pilots in the Ukrainian Air Force on things like the A-10 and then transfer those weapons systems to … Ukraine. It doesn't take a year to train a new pilot. You're taking a pilot, putting him on a new platform, or giving him more ammunition, doing something. … Earlier on, we delayed.

Israel’s Bennett speaks with Putin, Zelenskyy separately in effort to mediate Ukraine crisis

TEL AVIV — Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett held talks with President Vladimir Putin Saturday in the Kremlin over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and then spoke with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, an attempt to mediate a conflict that has caused growing civilian casualties and refugees.

Before Mr. Bennett’s visit, diplomacy by President Biden and European leaders failed to stop Mr. Putin from invading Ukraine or rolling back his tanks. In the face of massive Western sanctions, Mr. Putin has found himself increasingly cut off from the world, with few avenues for diplomacy and with his country’s economy unplugged from much of global commerce.

Mr. Bennett’s meeting with Mr. Putin took place "with the blessing of the U.S. administration," said Mr. Bennett’s office, which also noted that it coordinated with Germany and France. After seeing Mr. Putin, Mr. Bennett left Moscow for Berlin, where he met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the prime minister’s office said. Mr. Bennett was joined by Housing Minister Zeev Elkin, who was born in the now Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and assisted with the translation.

Putin has his 'hands full' in Ukraine, former US defense chief Robert Gates says

Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told "One Nation with Brian Kilmeade" on Saturday what Russian President Vladimir Putin would need to achieve to secure Ukraine and install a puppet government.

ROBERT GATES: He has nowhere near enough troops to put down a rebellion among millions of people in Ukraine, so he's going to have to keep a significant military force in Ukraine. He's probably going to have to increase it if he wants to hold on to that country, even if he imposes a puppet government, he's going to have to keep forces there to keep that government in power. So I think between having his hands full in Ukraine and the risk of a true war with NATO, I think he'll be very cautious about doing anything that crosses borders of NATO countries.

In war-torn areas of Ukraine, residents fled on footpaths and grief-stricken parents mourned dead children as Russian troops continued to shell encircled cities.

A promised cease-fire in the port city of Mariupol collapsed Saturday amid scenes of terror in the besieged town, where a stream of residents with pets and children crossed the Irpin River on an improvised path under a bridge destroyed by a Russian airstrike.

In comments carried on Ukrainian television, Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said thousands of residents had gathered for safe passage out of the city when shelling began that morning.

Ten days into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, 1.45 million people have fled the battered country, according to the U.N.-affiliated Organization for Migration in Geneva.

Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee demands Russia release Brittney Griner: 'No right'

Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee demands Russia release Brittney Griner: 'No right'

Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner (42) looks to pass as Chicago Sky center Candace Parker defends during the first half of game 1 of the WNBA basketball Finals , Sunday, Oct. 10, 2021, in Phoenix. Griner was arrested in Russia last month at a Moscow airport after a search of her luggage revealed vape cartridges. The Russian Customs Service said Saturday, March 5, 2022, that the cartridges were identified as containing oil derived from cannabis, which could carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. The customs service identified the person arrested as a female player for the U.S. national team and did not specify the date of her arrest. (AP Photo/Ralph Freso, File)

U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, is demanding the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner, who has been detained by authorities in Russia for allegedly possessing a vape with cannabis oil.

"We know that there were some issues dealing with vape cartridges and other items," Lee said Saturday, "but let me be very clear: Brittney Griner is a United States citizen, she was a guest in Russia…and I will be demanding her release."

Lee's 18th Congressional District is located in Houston, which is Griner’s hometown. The congresswoman added that she had spoken with the State Department to "try and get them to focus on [Griner's] circumstances."

"I don’t want to disregard a sovereign nation but Putin has disregarded sovereign nations his entire service in this world," Lee said. "Anyone that is killing and attacking and destroying Ukraine, a neighboring country that is not bothering them, has no right to hold Ms. Griner. Period."
