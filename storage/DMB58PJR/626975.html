 may be notable exceptions). A primary reason for Ukraine’s success, 
they argue, is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a former actor 
whose leadership style, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/02/zelensky-ukraine-president-selfie-video-kyiv/622949/">media savvy</a>, and earnest, emotional appeals have helped channel sympathy and aid for his country. He is, as one <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/president-zelensky-is-becoming-a-respected-war-hero-and-a-cultural-icon-11646079007">headline</a> put it, “a respected war hero and a cultural icon.”</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Zelensky’s
 performance of wartime leadership has been remarkable for the way it 
has made use of a new media environment and shaped public opinion. 
Still, we should be wary of declaring winners and losers of the 
information war so soon. Like the war on the ground, its scale is 
dizzying and dynamic: Momentary success in online conflict is not 
necessarily indicative of future success. I’ve been struck by how the 
conflict’s digital footprint has both confirmed and upended some 
long-held understandings and expectations of information warfare. Over 
the past half decade, activists, journalists, and academics around the 
world have studied and documented how information flows across the 
internet and how it is manipulated. Over the past two weeks, some have 
learned that their conclusions are of less use in wartime.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">The
 first surprise is that, despite a lot of noise, a strong signal has 
been coming from the front lines. On an internet where propaganda and 
conspiracy theorizing flourish, you’d expect a land war involving Russia
 to result in a bewildering barrage of online garbage and falsehoods 
that render the current state of the conflict truly unknowable. But 
documentation of the actual military action has emerged with clarity 
throughout the West. We’ve seen plenty of examples of misinformation, 
disinformation, and media manipulation: Opportunists are attempting to 
pass off historical clips, or even <a href="https://mediamanipulation.org/tip-sheets/viral-instances-recontextualized-media-russias-war-ukraine">video gameplay</a>,
 as fresh war footage, for example. Yet digital fakes are also being 
debunked in real time, while real footage is verified by a cohort of 
trained investigators from newsrooms and volunteer organizations. Across
 apps such as Telegram, there are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2022/03/01/ukraine-propaganda-machine-might-be-winning-against-russia/?sh=6f6066ee536d">channels with thousands of people</a>—an “army of hackers,” as a <em>Forbes</em>
 article calls them—attempting to report and take down information from 
Russian state media and coordinate cyberattacks against Russia.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" class="ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__v6EBD" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/">Read our ongoing coverage of the Russian invasion in Ukraine</a></p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">“There’ve
 been moments at this early juncture where it’s felt like the first time
 the information war was won by the disinformation fighters,” Eliot 
Higgins, one of the founders of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/01/business/media/open-source-journalism-bellingcat.html">Bellingcat project</a>,
 told me this week. Higgins, who got his start covering global conflicts
 online in 2012 during the Syrian war, helped pioneer the field of 
open-source investigation, which uses public footage and imagery posted 
on social media to find and organize evidence of fighting and 
atrocities. Higgins and Bellingcat have focused much of their attention 
on Russia and Ukraine since 2014, when they began looking into the 
downing of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/how-technology-is-unraveling-the-clues-of-flight-mh17/374814/">Malaysia Airlines Flight 17</a>
 in Donetsk Oblast. “There is a preexisting network in this region that 
stretches back to 2014 and that has not gone away,” he said. 
“Journalists are following this network; policy makers are following it.
 And so you have videos rapidly geolocated and preserved for war-crimes 
evidence, and it makes it extremely hard for false Russian narratives to
 take hold.” Higgins believes that Bellingcat’s work has influenced 
others too. Many newsrooms now incorporate open-source investigation 
into their war reporting. (<em>The New York Times</em>’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/visual-investigations">visual-investigations team</a> is one notable example.)</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/jane-lytvynenko/">Jane Lytvynenko</a>,
 a senior research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein 
Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, argues that online 
audiences, especially those who monitor breaking news, are a bit more 
skeptical than they used to be, and better able to spot influence 
attempts. She told me that open-source investigators like those working 
at and alongside Bellingcat “have made Russia’s motivations much 
clearer” than Vladimir Putin would like. “Not only can we untangle their
 false-flag operations and disinformation, but we can show how poorly 
executed these propaganda attempts really are,” she said.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">That’s
 the second surprise: Russia’s online propaganda and influence apparatus
 is not nearly as sophisticated or effective with non-Russian audiences 
as many thought (at least to this point). Russia’s early attempts to 
falsely portray Ukraine as a nation of neo-Nazis have been lazy, 
recycling old material, Higgins told me. “There’s been so much talk of 
how amazing Russia is at disinformation. But we see it’s not that they 
were good, but that the rest of us weren’t prepared for it. We weren’t 
good at verifying or debunking, and we confused our own incompetence for
 Russian genius.” Still, some Kremlin fake-news campaigns have been <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxdb5z/redfish-media-russia-propaganda-misinformation">successful</a>, and it’s certainly possible that Russia’s propaganda apparatus was merely caught flat-footed by the invasion, and <a href="https://twitter.com/elisethoma5/status/1499532040135655425">hasn’t yet revved up</a>.</p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__oTAAd ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__Qfi5x"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"> <p lang="en">Tldr; Western analysts, please stop declaring that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ukraine</a> is winning the narrative war. That battle is just getting started.</p> — Elise Thomas (@elisethoma5) <a href="https://twitter.com/elisethoma5/status/1499532107068375042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">And
 then there’s the opposite side to all of this: the information war 
Russia is waging on its own citizens—both the information it broadcasts 
and the outside information it <a href="https://twitter.com/mathieuvonrohr/status/1499528927458508809">blocks from its public</a>.
 Of all the elements of this crisis, this may be the most difficult for 
outsiders to evaluate effectively. It is also a reminder to be humble in
 our predictions—what might appear to our eyes as ineffective propaganda
 may read differently to audiences at home. Despite the remarkable 
footage of Russians protesting the war, reporting also suggests that 
Kremlin messaging has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/world/europe/ukraine-russia-families.html">deceived some Russians</a> into denying the very existence of the conflict.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">We
 may be seeing just how hard it is to wage a successful information war 
when you are very clearly the villain. Russia’s invasion and the 
harrowing images of destruction of Ukrainian cities have created a 
global crisis and a moral consensus that is unusual in the internet era.
 Lytvynenko said that Ukrainians have also excelled at telling the world
 what’s happening to them. Their message of resilience, she argued, has 
been amplified by a large Ukrainian diaspora across the web. “Right now,
 during a shooting war, you would expect to see Russia attempting to 
create chaos and confusion and to demoralize the people in the war 
zone,” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/renee-diresta/">Renée DiResta</a>,
 a computational-propaganda expert, told me this week. “And there is 
both a leader who is very adeptly keeping up morale and maintaining 
trust, and a cadre of volunteers working against that.”</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Universally
 accepted narratives can be fleeting, though, especially when media 
scrutiny fades. The world is tuning in to the hourly news from Ukraine 
right now, says Mike Caulfield, a researcher at the University of 
Washington’s Center for an Informed Public, but attention is always 
fickle. “I do worry, when the attention isn’t so intense, there could be
 more attempts to muddle the narrative,” he told me. Caulfield pointed 
to the events of January 6, and argued that the constant airing of 
footage initially led to a widespread condemnation of the insurgency, 
but that, with some distance from that intense coverage, many 
participants and Republicans tried to rewrite the story.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Ukraine,
 of course, has its own propaganda aims. Official government accounts 
have helped amplify stories of questionable veracity, such as a debunked
 anecdote about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/technology/ukraine-war-misinfo.html">reported</a>
 deaths of the soldiers stationed at Snake Island. Some of these stories
 have been amplified uncritically by those affected by the scenes coming
 from Ukraine, leading to what <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/technology/ukraine-war-misinfo.html">has called</a> a “blend” of fact and mythmaking. One Russia and Ukraine expert <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/opinion/ukraine-livestream-videos.html">suggested</a>
 that large chunks of the information we are seeing across our feeds at 
any given moment are “unverified or just flat out false.” Errors in our 
understanding of what is happening on the ground may, at times, be less a
 product of malice or incompetence than of the size of the conflict and 
the magnitude of our biases. For example, a recent video allegedly 
showing a Ukrainian man smoking a cigarette and calmly carrying an 
unexploded land mine to safety quickly made the rounds on Twitter. While
 some observers delighted in the man’s bravery and nonchalance, others 
saw evidence of <a href="https://puck.news/europes-9-11/">impending doom</a>.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Obsessing
 over winners in an information war can be fraught, even dangerous. 
Peter Pomerantsev, a senior fellow at John Hopkins University’s SNF 
Agora Institute and a scholar of Russian propaganda, <a href="https://time.com/5722805/rethink-information-war-russia/">argued in 2019</a>
 that the information-war lens risks “reinforcing a world view the 
Kremlin wants—that all information is just manipulation.” On Twitter, 
Pomerantsev speculated that too much focus on information warfare could 
flatten what he sees as a crucial difference between Russian and 
Ukrainian approaches to information. “Collaborative communication is 
when you engage people, treat them as equals,” he wrote. “Sure the 
Ukrainian army do all sort of psy-ops to survive. But Ze[lensky] is 
treating people as equals, trying to engage and inspire them—that’s not 
‘information war’. It’s the opposite.”</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Brandon
 Silverman, the creator of the digital-transparency tool CrowdTangle, 
has been studying and tracking the way that information moves around the
 internet’s biggest platforms. He’s learned to be extremely cautious in 
making any broad judgments about what he’s seeing online, he told me. 
When I asked for his early observations on the conflict’s digital side, 
he demurred without having the hindsight of a more forensic examination.
 “I’m not going to feel like I have an epistemically confident 
understanding of what has happened for probably about six to nine 
months,” he said.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Silverman 
is focused on the nuances of the information war from the platform side,
 where social networks have begun to shut out Russian state-media 
channels such as RT. He’s less concerned about the content and far more 
worried about process and transparency. Social-media platforms have been
 taking down and fully deleting Russian state media channels, he warned,
 instead of archiving them to study later. “If you are looking back a 
year from now, researchers and historians and those investigating war 
crimes will want to know, what were these channels doing leading up to 
this invasion?” he said. “How can we learn how effective a piece of 
propaganda was if we can’t go back and study it?”</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Speaking
 with these experts convinced me that we may well have more real-time 
access to accurate information about conditions on the ground than we 
have had for any other conflict, but that the status of an information 
war is much larger than defining the aggressors and the victims. We 
should not adopt a dangerous post-truth mindset, but we must remember 
that what is verifiable is likely still surpassed by what we don’t yet 
know or cannot see. In the middle of a so-called information war, as in 
the middle of a ground war, it is easy to make confident judgments too 
early and be seduced by simple narratives. What seems to make sense now 
may not make sense tomorrow. And the footage we see, no matter how 
indelible, could be interpreted quite differently through another’s 
eyes.</p><div class="ArticleBody_partialDivider__mhy5a" id="article-end" style="height:1px"></div></section><div class="ArticleWell_root__MEFqL"><div></div></div><div></div></article><div></div></main><div></div><div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"isLoggedIn":false,"hasPaywallAccess":false,"pageProps":{"urqlState":{"2021745665":{"data":"{\"breakingNews\":{\"id\":\"BreakingNews:13\",\"kicker\":null,\"text\":\"Read \u003cem\u003eThe Atlantic\u003c/em\u003e’s continuing coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine here.\",\"url\":\"https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/\",\"theme\":\"BLUE\",\"__typename\":\"BreakingNews\"}}"},"2266852740":{"data":"{\"article\":{\"id\":\"BlogArticle:626975\",\"isTnfCompatible\":true,\"layout\":\"standard\",\"hasMeter\":true,\"url\":\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/03/russia-ukraine-war-propaganda/626975/\",\"__typename\":\"BlogArticle\"}}"},"3243100718":{"data":"{\"article\":{\"__typename\":\"BlogArticle\",\"id\":\"BlogArticle:626975\",\"isTnfCompatible\":true,\"datePublished\":\"2022-03-08T17:23:54Z\",\"title\":\"The Information War Isn’t Over Yet\",\"slug\":\"russia-ukraine-war-propaganda\",\"wordCount\":1874,\"layout\":\"standard\",\"isFreelance\":false,\"isPython3\":true,\"preview\":null,\"watsonInfo\":{\"topCategory\":{\"full\":\"/society/unrest and war\",\"one\":\"society\",\"two\":\"unrest and war\",\"three\":null,\"four\":null,\"__typename\":\"WatsonTopCategory\"},\"categories\":[\"/society/unrest and war\",\"/law, govt and politics\",\"/law, govt and politics/politics\"],\"__typename\":\"WatsonInfo\",\"keywords\":[\"information war\",\"major media outlets\",\"Russian state media\",\"losers of the information war\",\"respected war hero\",\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\",\"real time\",\"past half decade\",\"influence attempts\",\"fresh war footage\",\"online conflict\",\"Eliot Higgins\",\"senior research fellow\",\"ongoing coverage of the Russian invasion\",\"use of a new media environment\",\"conflict’s digital footprint\",\"Official government accounts\",\"here.Russia’s invasion\",\"Jane Lytvynenko\",\"propaganda attempts\",\"Kremlin fake-news campaigns\",\"expectations of information warfare\",\"social media\",\"Ukraine’s success\",\"primary reason\",\"leadership style\",\"media savvy\",\"early juncture\",\"land war\",\"harrowing images of destruction of Ukrainian cities\",\"Peter Pomerantsev\",\"plenty of examples of misinformation\",\"field of open-source investigation\",\"false Russian narratives\",\"Ukraine\",\"Public Policy\",\"video gameplay\",\"Russia\",\"Mike Caulfield\",\"Elise Thomas\",\"much talk\",\"senior fellow\",\"stories of questionable veracity\",\"Russia’s early attempts\",\"much focus\",\"digital fakes\",\"Brandon Silverman\",\"Russia’s online propaganda\",\"founders of the Bellingcat project\",\"dozen headlines\"]},\"grapeshot\":{\"segments\":[\"neg_fx\",\"neg_hbo\",\"gt_negative\",\"an_apple_negative\",\"neg_att\",\"neg_microsoft\",\"neg_apple_1\",\"neg_vca\",\"neg_apple_2\",\"neg_ukraineinvasion\",\"an_saudiaramco\",\"gt_negative_mistrust\",\"an_bankofamerica_negative\",\"gv_military\",\"gt_negative_fear\",\"gs_tech\",\"an_bp\",\"gt_positive_curiosity\",\"facebook_safety\",\"pos_alcohol\",\"pos_chasemarriott\",\"pos_citibank\",\"pos_creditcard\",\"pos_disasters\",\"pos_diseases\",\"pos_disney_fxfargo\",\"pos_ey\",\"pos_hermes\",\"pos_ibm\",\"pos_mobkoi\",\"pos_septembereleven\",\"an_fidelity_safe\",\"ap_citi_banking_safe\",\"ap_citi_hurricanes\",\"ap_citi_sex_safe\",\"ap_citi_transportation_safe\",\"ap_fidelity_safe\",\"shadow9hu7_pos_facebook_safety\",\"gs_entertain\",\"gs_politics\"],\"__typename\":\"Grapeshot\"},\"editorialProject\":null,\"seoTitle\":\"The Information War Between Ukraine and Russia Is Far From Over\",\"shareTitle\":\"The Information War Isn’t Over Yet\",\"dek\":\"The online fight between Russia and Ukraine has already surprised propaganda experts.

I’ve been struck by how the conflict’s digital footprint has both confirmed and upended some long-held understandings and expectations of information warfare.

Higgins, who got his start covering global conflicts online in 2012 during the Syrian war, helped pioneer the field of open-source investigation, which uses public footage and imagery posted on social media to find and organize evidence of fighting and atrocities. Higgins and Bellingcat have focused much of their attention on Russia and Ukraine since 2014, when they began looking into the downing of \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/how-technology-is-unraveling-the-clues-of-flight-mh17/374814/\\\"\u003eMalaysia Airlines Flight 17\u003c/a\u003e in Donetsk Oblast. “There is a preexisting network in this region that stretches back to 2014 and that has not gone away,” he said. “Journalists are following this network; policy makers are following it. And so you have videos rapidly geolocated and preserved for war-crimes evidence, and it makes it extremely hard for false Russian narratives to take hold.” Higgins believes that Bellingcat’s work has influenced others too.
