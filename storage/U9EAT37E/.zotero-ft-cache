At least 17 people, including staffers and patients, were injured after a maternity hospital in Mariupol was struck by Russian forces, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday.

Images of the aftermath show injured pregnant women being carried from the scene. Videos shared on social media and verified by The Washington Post show damage to a clinic, with windows blown out and medical gear destroyed.

Mariupol’s city council said the destruction was “colossal,” and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called it an “atrocity.”

“What kind of country is this, the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals and maternity hospitals and destroys them?” Zelensky said in a video address late Wednesday, during which he switched from Ukrainian to Russian, making a direct appeal to a Russian audience.

The reported assault occurred after the World Health Organization said it had verified 18 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine.

It also came amid a fresh attempt to evacuate civilians Wednesday after Russia and Ukraine announced routes for people to leave hard-hit cities. After accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces of shelling the escape routes four days in a row , Ukrainian officials remained skeptical of the temporary cease-fire announcements. Officials in Izyum, one of the cities set to be evacuated, said Wednesday that efforts to get civilians out were compromised by shelling from Russian forces. Other evacuations appeared to be proceeding.

Here’s what to know

    Local officials in the northeastern Sumy region, from which 5,000 people were able to evacuate a day earlier , said people were leaving in private cars and that they planned to load 22 buses with people, prioritizing pregnant women, women with children, older people and people with disabilities.
    Ukraine’s state-owned grid operator warned that the closed Chernobyl nuclear power plant has been disconnected from the nation’s power grid by Russian forces, potentially jeopardizing the cooling of nuclear fuel still stored at the site. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba demanded a cease-fire with Russia to allow repairs, and another official called it an “extremely dangerous situation.”
    Ukraine’s confirmed civilian casualty count rose Wednesday, the United Nations reported . Since Russia’s invasion began, at least 516 people have been killed, including 37 children, and more than 900 others have been injured. However, the real toll probably is far higher, and accurate figures are impossible to ascertain due to the difficult conditions on the ground.

The United States turned down an offer from Poland on March 8 to transfer its MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base in Germany to be used by Ukraine. (Reuters)

The Pentagon on Wednesday ruled out any U.S. participation in efforts to send Ukraine additional fighter aircraft, warning that such a step could be seen by Russian leaders as “escalatory” while assessing any potential gains would be “low.”

“We do not support the transfer,” the Defense Department’s chief spokesman, John Kirby, told reporters at the Pentagon, citing intelligence suggesting that the United States taking such steps at this time could be a “mistake.”

The debate over equipping Ukraine with warplanes has grown more urgent in recent days, as President Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed to NATO member countries for help establishing a no-fly zone — or at least supplying Kyiv with the means to better police its skies alone. On Tuesday, the Pentagon quashed a Polish proposal to put its Soviet-origin MiG-29s in Germany to be used by the United States in aiding the Ukrainian war effort.

About 1,000 evacuated through ‘humanitarian corridor’ from Zaporizhizhia nuclear power plant

ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — Hundreds of families trapped for days in the area around a nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine were evacuated Wednesday night, after Russia agreed to allow civilians to leave through “humanitarian corridors.”

They took buses to Zaporizhzhia, a 75-mile drive from the nuclear power plant that was attacked and seized by Russian forces a week ago. But Zaporizhzhia Gov. Oleksandr Starukh said the corridor between there and the besieged port city of Mariupol remains “incredibly difficult.”

Valentyna Oskolkova, 24, cradled her 5-month-old girl as she waited to get off the bus and have her information recorded before being ferried to an overnight shelter. Residents described how they had watched in horror as the battle raged at the nuclear power station.

“We understood that if it explodes, nothing will survive,” she said.

The situation had been “extremely hard,” she said. “There were no products in the stores, we didn’t have any food or medicine and people were scared to go outside.”

Oskolkova made it out with her 4-year-old son and her husband, but she said it had taken a battle to get her husband onto the bus. She had argued that she couldn’t handle the children on her own.

Others were forced to leave their partners behind, with limited space on buses. The convoy of buses and cars was held up for four hours in Vasilivka, according to Ukrainian officials.

Russia allows patent theft from anyone in ‘unfriendly’ countries
Return to menu

Russia has effectively legalized patent theft from anyone affiliated with countries “unfriendly” to it, declaring that unauthorized use will not be compensated.

The decree , issued this week, illustrates the economic war waged around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as the West levies sanctions and pulls away from Russia’s huge oil and gas industry. Russian officials have also raised the possibility of lifting restrictions on some trademarks, according to state media , which could allow continued use of brands such as McDonald’s that are withdrawing from Russia in droves.

The effect of losing patent protections will vary by company, experts say, depending on whether they have a valuable patent in Russia. The U.S. government has long warned of intellectual property rights violations in the country; last year Russia was among nine nations on a “priority watch list” for alleged failures to protect intellectual property. Now Russian entities could not be sued for damages if they use certain patents without permission.

CHISINAU, Moldova — The historic stream of refugees from Ukraine — 2 million people in two weeks — is mostly composed of women and children, who have been forced to separate from husbands and fathers, in one of the most excruciating aspects of this war. Most Ukrainian men ages 18 to 60 have been barred from leaving the country, in anticipation that they may be called to fight. Their president has stayed, eliciting international recognition as a “hero.”

But the martial law aimed at bolstering the resistance is not absolute. There are exemptions — fathers with three or more children can leave, as can people with medical problems. There are also ways to sneak out: bribes to border guards, furtive dashes through unattended parts of the border. What’s clear, among the men who escaped, is that their decisions have had the capacity both to save them and shatter them.

In interviews across Moldova, 10 Ukrainian men described making it here through all sorts of means. One 38-year-old said he fled Odessa with his family in the first hours of Russia’s invasion, making it out of the country before Ukraine imposed martial law — only to later feel so ashamed that he began volunteering to help subsequent refugees. Others said their ability to make it out perhaps had depended on nothing more than the person manning the Ukrainian exit booth.

Gas prices are hitting new highs. Here’s why — and how long the surge could last.

Gas prices have hit record highs in recent days as reactions to Russia’s assault on Ukraine diminish the availability of crude oil and create a stark imbalance between supply and demand.

The cost per gallon of gasoline in the United States hovered around $4.30 on Wednesday, shattering a record of $4.10 set just before the financial crisis in 2008, according to the price-tracking service GasBuddy. In the first week of March, prices rose by about $0.49 — roughly 14 percent.

Customers filling up their tanks are expressing frustration with the increased cost of commuting to work, dropping off their children at school, or driving to visit family members. Amid rising instability in Russia, the world’s top oil exporter, the economic pain probably will not end anytime soon.

Prosecutor general floats special tribunal to investigate allegations of Russian war crimes
Return to menu

Ukraine’s prosecutor general says an ad hoc tribunal is needed to hold individuals responsible for Russian military aggression in Ukraine.

Iryna Venediktova said at a news conference Wednesday that Russia is destroying the lives of Ukrainian citizens, and their cities and schools.

“Russian bombs are being fired into hospitals and into schools, killing our children,” she said. “These are war crimes and crimes against humanity that have been committed on our land by the invaders, and all involved in the commission of these crimes should be and shall be held responsible.”

As of Wednesday, Ukrainian courts had issued more than 40 orders against Russian politicians, authorities and supporters of the invasion, marking them as suspicious individuals connected to the war. Ukrainian courts are taking steps to declare these individuals “internationally wanted,” according to Venediktova.

Ukraine has pleaded with The Hague-based International Criminal Court to make Russia end its encroachment on its land. Russia this week snubbed International Court of Justice hearings and left empty seats in the Great Hall of Justice, the Associated Press reported.

More than nine countries have appealed to the ICC, which investigates alleged crimes against humanity, genocide, war crimes and crimes of aggression, to bring “top-level criminals” to justice for attacks on Ukrainians, according to Venediktova.

Ukraine and Russia are not among the 123 member nations of the ICC because they didn’t ratify the 1998 treaty that established the court, but Ukraine has accepted the ICC’s jurisdiction over alleged crimes in the country since 2014 .

War crimes are difficult to prosecute, and the ICC has issued five convictions for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide from 38 defendants, Reuters reported.

“We don’t rule out the creation of an additional international mechanism to investigate a crime of aggression,” Venediktova said.

Estonia, Germany, Latvia and Poland have opened domestic criminal proceedings to investigate potential war crimes in Ukraine.

Ukraine puts captured Russians on stage. Is that a violation of POW rights?
Return to menu

ODESSA, Ukraine — Three prisoners of war were ushered into the room by an armed guard. The first wore a gray sweater and jeans. He walked with his hands behind his back and stared at the floor. He took a seat at the long table in front, looking like a scared teenager.

“Good lord, he can’t be older than 18, can he?” one journalist in the audience whispered.

His two comrades took their places beside him. One wore slippers over his socks. The other was in a collared shirt. They each said their name, birth date, place of birth and their Russian military unit. They gave statements of contrition — one said he was ashamed to look into the eyes of Ukrainians.

Then their captors opened the floor for questions from journalists.

Ukraine’s POW news conferences have become an unconventional and ethically — and potentially legally — questionable fixture of its war with Russia, representative of the two countries’ battle over information. While Moscow prohibits even the use of the words “war” or “invasion” — Russian state media calls this a “special operation” and does not acknowledge that its military has shelled civilian areas — Ukraine is parading around captured Russian soldiers to counter the Kremlin’s propaganda with its own.

News conferences have been an effective tool for gaining international attention: One video that went viral on social media tallied more than 100,000 retweets and 200,000 likes on Twitter. But international organizations and observers have said they could violate the Geneva Conventions, which have extensive rules covering treatment of prisoners of war.

Europe’s plan to wean off Russian energy could lead to price shocks and political blowback

BRUSSELS — The invasion of Ukraine has convinced the European Union that it is time to wean off cheap and abundant Russian energy. But that won’t be easy — in fact, an E.U. official warned, it will be “bloody hard.”

A day after the European Commission presented a plan to cut Russian natural gas imports by two-thirds by year’s end, steeply reducing — but not outright banning — Russian energy, the E.U. nations are scrambling to figure out how to implement the measures and bracing for an economic punch that could shape politics for years to come.

Europe is broadly united in its desire to hit Russian President Vladimir Putin for his aggression and destruction in Ukraine. But across the continent, politicians are warning of price shocks and inflation. Energy prices risk becoming an issue in next month’s French presidential election. The word “embargo” was trending on German Twitter.

About 35,000 evacuated through humanitarian corridors, Zelensky says, as thousands more remain trapped

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late Wednesday that despite skepticism over Russia’s promised temporary cease-fires and scattered reports of continued shelling, about 35,000 people had been evacuated that day from conflict areas through three humanitarian corridors.

Ukrainian officials have said for days that Moscow is thwarting its civilian evacuation efforts : On Tuesday, one precarious route was available, from the city of Sumy in the country’s northeast. One day later, Zelensky said two more had opened, from the area around Kyiv and Enerhodar, a port city on the Dnieper River in southeastern Ukraine. Thousands remain trapped in several other cities under Russian assault. Leaders in Izyum said Russian forces were preventing their evacuation efforts.

“We will continue tomorrow,” Zelensky said in Wednesday’s video address. “We are preparing six corridors. We pray that people will be taken out of Mariupol, Izyum, Volnovakha, etc., taken to safe cities of our free Ukraine.”

Zelensky also denounced Russia’s reported bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol, accusing the Kremlin of indiscriminate killing.

“What kind of country is this, the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals and maternity hospitals and destroys them?” Zelensky said, switching from Ukrainian to Russian, as if to make a direct appeal to a Russian audience.

“It is beyond atrocities already,” he said. “Everything that the invaders are doing to Mariupol is beyond atrocities already. Europeans! Ukrainians! Mariupol residents! Today, we must be united in condemning this war crime of Russia, which reflects all the evil that the invaders brought to our land.”
What are cluster and thermobaric ‘vacuum’ weapons, and how has Russia used them in the past?

As more and more people are injured or killed in Russia’s war against Ukraine, Moscow faces mounting allegations that it has used cluster and vacuum weapons, which can put civilians at increased risk, particularly when used in urban areas.

International rights groups reported that cluster munitions apparently fired by Russia seemed to have hit a preschool in northeastern Ukraine and an area near a hospital in the Kyiv-controlled part of the eastern Donetsk region in late February, killing several civilians.

Russian forces, according to Ukraine and rights groups, also used cluster munitions in strikes on Kharkiv , the country’s second-largest city and the center of intense fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces.

Britain’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday that its Russian counterpart had confirmed the deployment of the TOS-1A weapon system, which uses thermobaric rockets, in Ukraine.

Ukrainian cities are under siege, and the country is pleading with the West to send fighter jets.

But as a recent tiff between the United States and Poland over providing jets to Ukraine underscores, there are limits to what the United States and NATO are willing to do to help. World leaders are trying to ensure that the war does not expand beyond Ukraine’s borders or escalate into a direct confrontation between powers armed with nuclear weapons.

Here’s what happened between the United States and Poland, and what it says about the war in Ukraine.

Psaki says Russian claim that U.S. develops biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine is false

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday that Russia’s claims that there are “alleged U.S. biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine” are false.

Psaki also said Chinese officials have echoed these claims, which she described as “conspiracy theories.”

“This is preposterous,” Psaki said in a tweet.

“Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” Psaki added. “It’s a clear pattern.”

Psaki said the United States is in “full compliance” with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention, which call for the country to not develop or possess such weapons.

Psaki’s comments came after Russian officials made several claims accusing the United States of developing such weapons in Ukraine. Igor Konashenkov, the chief spokesman for Russia’s Defense Ministry, said it was “obvious that in the wake of the special military operation, the Pentagon started having serious concerns about secret biological experiments uncovered on the Ukrainian territory.”

Kremlin spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters Wednesday that Russia had concluded that “in Ukrainian laboratories close to our borders, components of biological weapons were being developed.”

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who recently voted against a House resolution supporting Ukraine, amplified Russia’s claims Thursday.

    There’s so much propaganda on both sides that I didn’t take the concern over Ukrainian biological labs seriously… until now. This is a serious admission, under oath, from a person who would know. https://t.co/XkOu4ky9Xz
    — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) March 9, 2022 

Psaki, on Twitter, said it is Russia that is in violation of international law because it continues supporting the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, which has used chemical weapons, and because it has “long maintained a biological weapons program.”

War in Ukraine: What you need to know

The latest: President Zelensky condemned as an atrocity a Russian airstrike that tore through a maternity hospital in Mariupol on Wednesday, injuring at least 17. Meanwhile, in the U.S., House lawmakers approved new humanitarian, economic and military assistance to Ukraine worth approximately $14 billion .

Oil exports: Russia is the world’s largest oil exporter, sending more than 7 million barrels of crude oil to countries around the world , including to Germany and other E.U. members.

The fight: Casualties are mounting in Ukraine — including civilians, while Moscow is facing allegations that it has used cluster and vacuum weapons . As many as 4,000 Russian soldiers may have died , according to a U.S. general.

Map: Russia’s assault on Ukraine has been extensive with strikes and attacks across the entire country.

The response: Russia’s war could be a global economic “game changer,” with rising gas prices and shifting trade decisions suggesting change that will be felt for years. Meanwhile, in Russia, online access has been significantly curtailed by censors at home and businesses abroad.
