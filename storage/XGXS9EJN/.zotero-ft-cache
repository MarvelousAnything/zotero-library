The United Nations’ atomic watchdog says Ukraine has informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that staff who have been kept at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant since Russian troops took control of the site a week ago are facing “psychological pressure and moral exhaustion”.

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said the staff must be allowed to rest and rotate so their crucial work can be carried out safely and securely.

Grossi received “a joint appeal from the Ukraine Government, regulatory authority and the national operator which added that personnel at the Chernobyl site ‘have limited opportunities to communicate, move and carry out full-fledged maintenance and repair work’”, the IAEA said in a statement.

US senators propose ban on Russian oil imports

A bipartisan group of US senators has introduced legislation that would ban all oil imports to the US from Russia.

“Energy has been weaponised. We have the ability to counter that weapon,” said Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who is part of a group calling on the Biden administration to boost US domestic oil production.

The proposal, titled the “Ban Russian Energy Imports Act”, also has the support of the top leader in the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.

But White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at an earlier media briefing that White House officials opposed blocking Russian oil imports because it would raise fuel prices for Americans.

Lions and tigers driven out of Ukraine to safety in Polish zoo

A truck carrying six lions, six tigers, two caracals and an African wild dog from a sanctuary east of Kyiv reached Poland on Thursday after a two-day drive to escape the Russian invasion, a Polish zoo official said.

The owner of the sanctuary had asked for help from Poznan zoo in western Poland to get the animals to safety.

“They had to go a long way around to avoid Zhytomyr and other bombardment zones. They had to turn back many times, because all the roads were blown up, full of holes, impossible to pass with such cargo, which is why it took so long,” said Poznan zoo spokesperson Malgorzata Chodyla.

“One of the elites is Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, one of Russia’s wealthiest individuals and a close ally of Putin,” the White House said in a statement.

“His property will be blocked from use in the United States and by US persons – including his superyacht, one of the world’s largest, and just seized by our ally Germany, and his private jet, one of Russia’s largest privately-owned aircraft.”

Ukraine and Russia have agreed to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in the second round of talks since Moscow invaded last week, a top Ukrainian official said.

Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari speaking from Moscow said it was clear Putin wanted to deliver a strong message,  “a united front to the Russian public”.

Russian television channel Dozhd, or TV Rain, is temporarily halting its work, its chief executive officer has said.

The move comes after the channel, one of the last remaining critical media outlets in the country, had its website blocked earlier this week amid a tightening of restrictions on reporting by the Kremlin amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.

“We need strength to … understand how we can work from here. We really hope that we will return to broadcasting and continue our work,” Natalia Sindeeva, TV Rain’s general director, said in a statement.

Hours earlier, the editor of Echo of Moscow said the radio station had been dissolved by its board.

France’s Macron tells Putin he is making a ‘major mistake’: Report

President Emmanuel Macron has warned his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that he is making a “major mistake” in Ukraine and that his government’s actions will cost Russia dearly over the long term, according to a French official cited by the Reuters news agency.

During talks by phone allegedly initiated by Putin, Macron also told the Russian president that he was deluding himself about the government in Kyiv, the unnamed French presidential adviser said.

Moscow has dismissed Zelenskyy’s administration as undemocratic, despite him having been elected with 73 percent of the vote in a 2019 presidential election.

“There was nothing in what President Putin said that could reassure us,” the adviser told Reuters, adding that Putin had reiterated his “narrative” that he was seeking the “de-Nazification of Ukraine”.

“You are lying to yourself,” Macron told Putin, the official said. “‘It will cost your country dearly, your country will end up isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time,” the French leader allegedly added.

No breakthrough expected at upcoming talks: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons, reporting from the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, says there is little hope the upcoming second round of talks will produce any agreement on ending the war.

“If anything there has been an escalation since they last met on Monday, [and] on that occasion they begged to differ massively on the issues, there was no common ground,” Simmons said.

“Some sort of move towards a confidence-building measure would be probably the best possible outcome of these talks right now,” he added.

“There is a call from Ukraine to prioritise a ceasefire but the problem is Russia is saying that they wish to demilitarise Ukraine, and really that stops any dialogue progressing, so it is hard to see how they will come out of this round of talks with any form of real progress.”

Aid chief calls for immediate ceasefire

The secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council has called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, saying aid workers cannot “save lives under a hail of bombs and grenades”.

“We cannot come to the relief of vulnerable communities engulfed by war when our aid workers are in bomb shelters and fleeing from attacks,” Jan Egeland said in a statement.

“Millions are now in front-line locations. With empty shops, overwhelmed healthcare, and no electricity or safe water, local and international aid groups on the ground must urgently resume our work,” he added, before warning of “mounting numbers of civilian casualties across the country”.

“The madness must stop. The men who started this war sit in safe and comfortable offices. They can end it today and resume meaningful political talks. Defenceless civilians are paying the highest price for their senseless war.”

Ukrainian, Russian officials trade barbs at UN Human Rights Council meeting

Ukraine’s first deputy foreign minister has accused Russian troops of carrying out acts tantamount to war crimes in her country and called for perpetrators to be held accountable.

“We must stand together to ensure accountability for the war criminals spilling the blood of Ukrainian children.”

Kuleba says Putin has ‘no chance of winning’, highlights Zaporizhzhia plant workers

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has called Moscow’s military onslaught a “People’s War for Ukraine”, highlighting an image of Ukrainian civilians blocking Russian troops from accessing the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in the southeastern city of Enerhodar as evidence of the country’s resolve.

“This is a true People’s War for Ukraine. [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has no chance of winning it,” Kuleba tweeted.

Footage posted online on Wednesday appeared to show that dozens of local residents and workers at the plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, had barred access to the facility as Russian forces advanced in the region.

Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Moscow had on Monday informed Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi that Russian military forces had taken control of the territory around the plant.

As of Thursday lunchtime, it was not immediately clear if the facility was still being blocked, or who was in control of the site.

‘Violence increasing every hour’: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons, reporting from the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, says there has been “no let-up in the scale of the violence” as Russia’s assault enters its second week.

“In fact it is increasing every hour, it would seem,” Simmons said.

“[The capture of] Kherson marks the first city in Ukraine to fall to the Russians and in doing so, it has devastated some level of morale [there],” he added.

“Ukrainian forces are nowhere to be seen in the city … [and] further down the coast, in Mariupol, the situation is just extraordinary.

“There is no food, no water, no fuel and very little hope for people [there]. Some were getting out at the last minute as convoys with tanks came the other way. But there are awful scenes from the city and the pressure on local hospitals is intense. There has been just no sparing of anything in the way the city has been shelled.”

Russian foreign minister claims Moscow ‘looking after its own security interests’

Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Moscow, says Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is adamant that Moscow is “looking after its own security interests” amid its invasion of Ukraine.

“He said the world was listening to Russia but he was not sure if it is hearing what the Russians are saying,” Jabbari said, citing comments Lavrov made during an online interview with Russian and foreign media.

“[And] he was adamant about his country’s position – that they are really under threat from neighbouring countries that are part of NATO,” she added.

Jabbari said that Lavrov made clear Russia was “still very much open to the idea of dialogue with NATO as well as the United States”, despite ties between Moscow and the West plunging to new lows over Moscow’s actions.

“We worked with the US the EU and G7 to cut off funding for Putin’s war machine,” Liz Truss told a news conference during a visit to Lithuania.

“[But] We need to go further. We must strive that all Russian banks are disconnected from SWIFT, we must dare to refuse energy imports from Russia to Europe,” she added.

Russia aims to stop Ukraine from joining NATO, Lavrov says

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said Moscow’s attack on Ukraine is aimed, among other things, at ensuring that its neighbour does not join the NATO transatlantic military alliance.

Lavrov told Russian state television that the country’s forces were attacking military targets but added that the term “collateral damage” has been in use since military campaigns waged by Washington and its Western allies in Iraq and Libya.

He added that Western powers were aware of Moscow’s concerns and said they would have to address them at some point, before referring to sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion as a “tax on independence”.

The council said it was seeking to create a humanitarian corridor for the city, as well as trying to restore infrastructure.

“We are being destroyed as a nation. This is genocide of Ukrainian people,” it said.

Zelenskyy says defence lines holding against Russian attacks

Ukraine’s defence lines are holding amid Russia’s multipronged assault, the country’s president says.

In his latest video address, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there had been no respite in Moscow’s shelling of his country since midnight.

But he pointed to Russia’s alleged shelling of civilian areas in several key cities as proof Ukraine had been successful in resisting the Kremlin’s initial plan of claiming a quick victory through a land assault.

“We have nothing to lose but our own freedom,” Zelenskyy said, adding Ukraine was receiving daily arms supplies from its international allies.

Why is Kherson strategically important?

Kherson, strategically located at the mouth of the Dnieper River’s exit into the Black Sea, is the first significant urban centre to fall since Moscow launched its invasion.

Control of the city, which is home to about 300,000 people, is important because it could allow Moscow to mass troops there and use it as a launching post to push its forces further inland.

Scramble to exit Kyiv becoming ‘ever more desperate’: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull, reporting from Lviv, says Western intelligence reports suggest Russia’s enormous military convoy near Kyiv has “stalled”.

“Nevertheless it is still there, its progress will no doubt continue and the people in Kyiv will be very aware that it is coming as the scramble to get out of the city becomes ever more desperate,” Hull said.

Elsewhere in the country, he added, Kharkiv had been under continued bombardment overnight and Kherson had “conclusively fallen” under the control of Russian forces.

“And, of course, the other major flashpoint now is Mariupol, to the east of Kherson … which is encircled and has endured appalling, constant hours of bombardment,” Hull said.

“The deputy mayor there is talking about a humanitarian catastrophe unfolding; he said the Russians are using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, air strikes and tactical rocket attacks on the city,” Hull added.

“The city is said to be cut off from heat, electricity and mobile and internet connectivity, so it’s really increasingly difficult to know what exactly is going on [there].”

UK says Russian convoy ‘delayed by staunch resistance’

The miles-long Russian military convoy north of Kyiv remains more than 30km (18 miles) from the capital as a result of it having been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance” and logistical issues, the United Kingdom’s defence ministry says.

“The column has made little discernible progress in over three days,” the ministry said in an intelligence update.

It added that the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol remain in Ukrainian control, despite intense Russian shelling.
