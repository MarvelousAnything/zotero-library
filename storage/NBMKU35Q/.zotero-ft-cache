Abstract 
 
The paper presents a comprehensive review of the biomass equations for 65 North American tree species. All equations are of the form M = aD b , where M is the oven-dry weight of the biomass component of a tree (kg), D is diameter at breast height (DBH) (cm), and a and b are parameters. Equations for the following tree components were included in the review: total aboveground biomass, stem wood, stem bark, total stem (wood and bark), foliage, and branches (wood and bark). A total of 803 equations are presented with the range of DBH values of the sample, sample size, coefficient of determination R 2 , standard error of the estimate, fitting method used to estimate the parameters a and b , correction factor for a bias introduced by logarithmic transformation of the data, site index and geographic location of the sampled stand(s), and a reference to the paper in which the equation (or the data) was published. The review is a unique source of equations that can be used to estimate tree biomass and/or to study the variation of biomass components for a tree species.
