In writing about the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s “Black American Portraits” I was captivated by Titus Kaphar Behind the Myth of Benevolence painting. In it, a Black woman peers out from behind what looks like a portrait of Thomas Jefferson that is “falling” off the picture plane. A striking image.

“Titus Kaphar Behind the Myth of Benevolence exposes, complicates and disrupts the notion, narrative and positionality of the so-called ‘benevolent’ founding father, Thomas Jefferson, our third president and author of the Declaration of Independence which articulated ‘all men are created equal with an equal right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,’ who owned more than 600 human beings,” Christine Y. Kim, Curator, Contemporary Art, LACMA, told me. “The ‘curtain’ is simultaneously revealing and concealing Sally Hemings, a Black woman he owned whose six children he fathered, portrayed in a more stark and dark representation than other images of her.

Broadley, the exhibition reframes portraiture to center Black American subjects , sitters and spaces. Primarily drawn from the museum’s permanent collection, “Black American Portraits, on view through April 17, 2021, features 140 works, including new acquisitions that will be on view for the first time.

Aside from Titus Kaphar Behind the Myth of Benevolence , artists featured in the exhibition include Jordan Casteel, Beauford Delaney, Kerry James Marshall, Archibald J. Motley Jr., Lorraine O’Grady, Augusta Savage, Amy Sherald , Mickalene Thomas, James Van Der Zee, Charles White, Kehinde Wiley, Deborah Willis and many more. In addition to work by artists of African descent, “Black American Portraits” includes several works by artists who are not of African descent but who have exemplified a thoughtfulness, sensitivity, and commitment to Black artists, communities, histories, and subjects, such as Edward Biberman, Bruce Davidson, rafa esparza, Shepard Fairey, Glenn Kaino, Alice Neel, Catherine Opie, and Betsy Graves Reynaud, among others.

Portraiture has provided a tool for generations of Black Americans to see themselves in their own eyes, countering a visual culture that often demonizes Blackness and fetishizes the spectacle of Black pain. “Black American Portraits” depicts Black figures in a range of mediums such as painting, drawing, prints, photography, sculpture, mixed media, and time-based media.

 The exhibition spans over two centuries, with highlights including a late-18th-century portrait of a sailor, early studio photography, scenes from the Harlem Renaissance , portraits from the Civil Rights era and Black Power movement, and works exploring the politics of identity made from the 1990s to the present day.

What a thrill to see these ENORMOUS Aminah Brenda What a thrill to see these ENORMOUS Aminah Brenda Lynn Robinson fabric ‘RagGonOn’ (Ragin’ On) artworks hanging in @freedomcenter in @visit_cincy @downtowncincy. I’d written about Robinson before, but never seen a ‘RagGonOn’ in person previously. The artworks are richly composed with stories of Black and African American history. Robinson is from Columbus, OH and @columbusmuseum has the largest collection of her work. #cincinnati #blackhistory #femaleartist #blackart #blackartist #blackculture #fabricart #museum
Every piece in @cummermuseum’s new exhibition, “American Perspectives: Stories from the American Folk Art Museum,” is an epic. An epic story of an artist and an epic story behind an artwork. Visit through May 22, 2022 and be sure to pick up the exhibition guide at the entrance to the show to learn about the remarkable details behind these items. #folkart #americanfolkart @afamuseum @visit_jax #jacksonville Hat tip to @artbridgesfoundation for help putting on the show.

What better way to wrap up my weekend arts odyssey What better way to wrap up my weekend arts odyssey across the Midwest than with my first ever visit to @diadetroit. It was all I had hoped for and more highlighted by #diegorivera “#detroit Industry Murals.” Art making and storytelling on the grandest of scales. The detail is amazing… the resolute, serious, weary faces of the workers, the cruelty in the faces of the managers, the capitalists… some things never change. Rich in symbolism, massive in vision, brilliant in composition, this is as good as artmaking gets. #mural #muralart #mexicanmuralist #artmuseum #labor #factory
How about these powerful and dramatic @luba.lukova How about these powerful and dramatic @luba.lukova.studio prints on view at @freedomcenter in @downtowncincy @visit_cincy. I had some free time on my visit yesterday and headed to the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center along the river, an extraordinary museum with a painful and necessary story to share. Grateful to have been able to stop by briefly. #lubalukova #cincinnati #downtowncincinnati #politicalposter #poster #posterdesign #posterart #politicalart
