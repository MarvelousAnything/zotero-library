President Biden offered a bleak warning on Thursday that Russia will attack Ukraine “in the next several days,” as the Kremlin rejected U.S. security proposals and shelling escalated in eastern Ukraine.

The warning from the president, just days after a brief hope that Russia was easing off its threats against Kyiv, came as optimism soured in Washington that it would be possible to avoid conflict in Ukraine. Speaking at the United Nations Security Council, Secretary of State Antony Blinken listed dire possibilities Russia could use as pretexts for an intervention, including staging a chemical weapons attack.

What to know

    Ukraine said shelling from separatists hit a kindergarten in Stanytsia Luhanska, blowing a hole in the side of the building. Three adults suffered concussions, officials said. No children were reported injured.
    The Russian government said it expelled the second-ranking U.S. diplomat , Deputy Chief of Mission Bart Gorman. A senior State Department official said Gorman departed last week.
    Blinken said the world faces “a moment of peril” and proposed meeting his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, next week in Europe.
    Biden said the threat of a Russian invasion remains “very high” and that Russia may be creating a pretext for it with a “false flag operation.”
    An observer mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said Thursday that it had counted 591 violations of the cease-fire in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, up from 153 the prior day.

The Dow plunged more than 600 points as the Russia-Ukraine crisis sent investors scrambling for cover.

U.S. and NATO officials have repeatedly said there’s been no sign of de-escalation at the border, despite Kremlin claims this week that some troops had been withdrawn. Western officials said Russia has actually beefed up its military presence with thousands of new troops . On Thursday, the State Department said Russia had expelled the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

Stocks have oscillated in tandem with headlines in previous sessions, and the trend continued in morning trading. By market’s close, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had declined more than 407 points, or 2.8 percent, to land at 13,716. The S&P 500 index shed 95 points, or 2.1 percent, ending at about 4,380. The Dow dipped 622 points, losing 1.8 percent, to finish at 34,312. All three indexes are down 4 percent or more year to date, according to MarketWatch .

Blinken warns of global ‘moment of peril’ as diplomats trade charges at U.N.

Diplomats traded charges at the United Nations on Thursday, as Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned of a global “moment of peril” and a top Russian official accused the United States of making “dangerous” allegations.

“This is a moment of peril for the lives and safety of millions of people, as well as for the foundation of the United Nations Charter and the rules-based international order that preserves stability worldwide,” Blinken told the U.N. Security Council during a session on the Minsk agreements, which were designed to end the long-running conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Providing new details to earlier U.S. warnings about potential “false-flag” actions by Russia, Blinken said actions aimed at triggering a conflict might include a “fabricated so-called terrorist bombing inside Russia,” a fake mass grave, a staged drone attack on civilians or a “fake, even a real, attack using chemical weapons.”

Blinken called on Russia to renounce any future invasion of Ukraine and send its forces back to their barracks. “The world will remember that commitment,” he said.

James Cleverly, a top British diplomat, said Russia was failing to live up to commitments on military transparency as it continued its troop buildup around Ukraine.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin, who chaired the meeting, rejected the accusations, saying Western nations had assumed an “ostrich-like position” on Ukraine and failed to pressure Ukraine to implement its side of the Minsk accords.

He said the United States, as part of its effort to preempt what American officials said could be a punishing assault on Ukraine, had set false expectations about when Russia might launch an attack. “The announced date of the so-called invasion is behind us,” he said sarcastically.

U.S. defense secretary tells NATO that Russia is adding forces, not drawing down

BRUSSELS — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, attending a NATO meeting in Brussels, told reporters Thursday that the reports of the shelling of a government-held village in eastern Ukraine are “certainly troubling” and that the United States is still gathering details.

“But you know, we’ve said for some time that the Russians might do something like this in order to justify a military conflict, so we’ll be watching this very closely,” he said.

At a news conference in Brussels, Austin said of Russia’s claims that it was pulling some of its forces from the border: “We don’t see that. Quite the contrary, we see them add to the more than 150,000 that they already have arrayed along their border even in the last couple of days. We’ve seen some of those troops inch closer to that border. We’ve seen them fly in more combat and support aircraft. We’ve seen them sharpen their readiness in the Black Sea. We’ve even seen them stocking up their blood supplies.”

He added: “You know, I was a soldier myself not that long ago, and I know firsthand that you don’t do these things for no reason, and you certainly don’t do them if you’re getting ready to pack up and go home.”

The U.S. Army will deploy a Stryker company to Bulgaria in the coming days, Austin said, joining thousands of U.S. troops who have mobilized along NATO’s eastern flank. They will depart from their home base in Germany, which has already sent Stryker vehicles and soldiers to Romania. Other service members and their equipment have arrived in Poland, part of a growing U.S. presence there.

In Washington, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley, held calls with his counterparts in Estonia and Latvia to discuss security in the Baltics and Eastern Europe, according to readouts provided by the Pentagon.

Horton reported from Kyiv and Demirjian from Washington.

The Russian government has expelled the U.S. Embassy’s second-ranking diplomat, Deputy Chief of Mission Bart Gorman, the State Department confirmed Thursday.

No reason was immediately given for the expulsion of Gorman, whom a department spokesperson described in a statement as “a key member of the Embassy’s senior leadership team.”

The State Department called the move “unprovoked” and “an escalatory step,” saying the United States is “considering our response.” An agency official said later that Gorman departed last week.

Separately, Russia on Thursday made public a written response to U.S. proposals submitted Jan. 26 regarding Moscow’s demands on halting NATO expansion. “In the absence of the readiness of the American side to agree on firm, legally binding guarantees of ensuring our security by the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including through the implementation of military-technical measures,” it said.

The letter from the Russian Foreign Ministry did not elaborate on “military-technical measures” but again denied any plans for a “‘Russian invasion’ of Ukraine, as has been officially claimed by the U.S. and its allies since last fall.” It added that “claims of ‘Russian responsibility for the escalation’ cannot be interpreted other than as an attempt to pressure and devalue Russian proposals on security guarantees.”

UNITED NATIONS — Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that a potential Russian false-flag action in Ukraine could include a “fabricated so-called terrorist bombing inside Russia,” a fake mass grave, a staged drone attack on civilians or a “fake, even a real, attack using chemical weapons.”

He added: “I am here today not to start a war but to prevent one.” He called on Russia to renounce any future invasion of Ukraine and send its forces back to their barracks. “The world will remember that commitment,” he said. “This is a moment of peril for the lives and safety of millions of people, as well as for the foundation of the United Nations charter and the rules-based international order that preserves stability worldwide.”

Blinken said he has asked his Russian counterpart to meet with him in Europe next week.

His made the remarks during a brief visit to the United Nations before departing for Munich to meet top European security officials at a conference there.

Earlier, President Biden told reporters at the White House that the threat of invasion remains “very high” and that Russia may be creating an excuse to do so.

“We have reason to believe that they are engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in,” Biden said before departing on a trip to Ohio. “Every indication we have is they’re prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine.” He added that “my sense is it will happen in the next several days.”

But Biden said a diplomatic resolution remains possible.

Government-held towns in eastern Ukraine shelled in cease-fire violations

The Ukrainian military reported 29 cease-fire violations up and down the border before noon on Thursday, the vast majority of them with weapons that violate previous agreements.

Separatists rained down artillery, mortar rounds and other munitions at the front, the military said in a statement posted to social media. In the village of Stanytsia Luhanska near Luhansk, an artillery strike blew a hole through a kindergarten building. Three adults suffered concussions, officials said. No children were reported injured.

The Ukrainian military said the village was struck by 32 artillery rounds.

It was not immediately clear whether the reported shelling amounted to more than the usual flare-ups in an eight-year war there, but the United States has warned that Russia could instigate an incident as a pretext for an attack.

Stanytsia Luhanska, a government-held village, sits outside the separatist-controlled city of Luhansk and has not often been targeted. Photos posted to social media showed a gaping hole in the kindergarten wall and soccer balls scattered amid the debris inside.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba denounced the shelling, which he blamed on Russia. He wrote Thursday on Twitter: “We call on all partners to swiftly condemn this severe violation of Minsk agreements by Russia amid an already tense security situation.” Kuleba referred to 2014-2015 accords aimed at ending the separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine.
