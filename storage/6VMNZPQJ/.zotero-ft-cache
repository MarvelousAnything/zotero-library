Abstract

A population-dynamical system is called permanent if all species survive, provided they are initially present. More precisely, a system is called permanent if there exists some level k > 0 such that if the number x i (0) of species i at time 0 ispositive for i = 1, 2, …, n , then x i ( t ) > k for all sufficiently large times t . In this paper conditions for permanence in prey-predator systems linked by interspecific competition of prey are deduced.

    Citation Excerpt :

    On higher trophic levels, however, resources may interact and the possibility of competition among the resources was originally pointed out by Levine [27] and empirically confirmed by Lynch [28]. Since then, a whole series of theoretical papers (based on MacArthur’s equations) have been published on two-predator, two-prey systems with interference competition between two self-reproducting prey species [21,29,30]. As seen from (3a) and (3b), there is no intraspecific interference competition within the resource populations, in distinction to MacArthur’s model.

    Positive almost periodic solutions for a delay logarithmic population model
    2011, Mathematical and Computer Modelling
    Citation Excerpt :

    There exists an extensive literature concerning the study of the dynamic behavior of temporally uniform environments governed by delay differential equations with periodic parameters; see the monographs [1–5] and the references cited therein. Among many population models existing in the literature, the logarithmic population model has recently attracted the attention of many mathematicians and biologists; see various types of logarithmic models in Refs. [5–12]. However, one can easily see that all equations considered in the above mentioned papers are subject to periodic assumptions and the authors, in particular, studied the existence of their periodic solutions.
