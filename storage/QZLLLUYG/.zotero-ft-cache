Catch up on the latest Ukraine news.

LVIV, Ukraine — Russia continued its broad offensive in Ukraine on Saturday, pummeling cities and towns into rubble, even as it announced a limited cease-fire for the besieged southern city of Mariupol , as well as for a second, smaller city. The Russian targeting of civilian infrastructure has set off a mass exodus of panicked people from cities including Kyiv, the capital, and created increasingly dire conditions for those who remain.

About half a million people in Mariupol, a coastal city, were entering their third day without heat, electricity or water on Saturday. Since Russian forces surrounded the city two days earlier, it has been largely impossible to bring in medical supplies and other relief. Despite daily bombardments, the local government has refused to surrender.

The United States and its allies have continued to ramp up their efforts to punish Russia’s economy for the increasingly brutal assault on Ukraine. But President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has tightened his government’s control over information about the war, has shown no intention of changing course.

Here are the latest developments:

    Russia’s military is trying to add to its gains in the south, moving closer to the vital port city of Odessa, as it tries to cut off the Ukrainian government from the sea.

    Outside Kyiv, there have been fierce attacks and counterattacks as Ukrainian forces battle to keep the Russians from encircling it. The vast armed convoy approaching Kyiv from the north still seems to be largely stalled, according to Western analysts, and the Ukrainian military says its forces have been attacking it where they can.

    NATO members are rushing to resupply the Ukrainians with Javelin and Stinger missiles and other weapons. American shipments represent the largest single authorized transfer of arms from U.S. military warehouses to another country, according to a Pentagon official.

    A video received by The New York Times gives a glimpse inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as Russian forces were attacking it on Friday. In the video, a warning is issued in Russian over the facility’s loudspeakers, apparently directed at the soldiers outside. “You are endangering the safety of the entire world,” a voice says.

    Russia blocked access to Facebook on Friday and enacted a law under which anyone spreading “false information” about the war could be sent to prison for 15 years. Several Western news media organizations said they would suspend their journalistic operations in Russia, including Bloomberg News and the BBC.

The governor of Ukraine’s Donetsk region said that Russian forces were observing their cease-fire only in that region and not along the entire evacuation corridor for residents of Mariupol. There are ongoing negotiations with the Russian side to guarantee the cease-fire along the whole route.

As the Russian military advance continues, Ukraine’s defense minister said on Saturday that his country’s forces and its cities were most vulnerable to air assault.

“Aircraft of all kinds is bombing cities, towns and civilian infrastructure, including critical and dangerous nuclear and hydropower plants,” the minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in a statement.

He said that the Russian assault had hit residential neighborhoods, schools, hospitals and churches, and that its forces had shelled transportation stations as people tried to flee.

The Russian forces’ primary efforts have been apparent in the encirclement of Kyiv, Mr. Reznikov said, and the weakening of resistance in the cities that the Russians have encircled or are pressing to capture.

He said that in Chernihiv, an area just north of Kyiv where dozens were killed after a missile struck an apartment complex there on Thursday, Ukrainian troops continued to hold their positions.

Ukrainian forces destroyed a key bridge over a river so that it Russian forces could not use it, he said. It is one of many bridges around the capital that have been blown up in an effort to slow the Russians.

Russia and Ukraine agreed to a limited “cease-fire” on Saturday morning to allow medicine and other essential supplies to be brought into the besieged coastal city of Mariupol and a smaller town in eastern Ukraine.

After Russia’s Defense Ministry announced the “cease-fire,” offering limited details about how it would work, local and national Ukrainian officials confirmed that “a regime of silence” would allow for “humanitarian corridors” to be opened.

“The enemy does not know the value of human life, but we will do everything for assistance to our citizens,” Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s defense minister, said in statement. “We hope that the humanitarian corridor will work and we will be able to evacuate civilians.”

Tens of thousands of Mariupol residents have been without heat, water and electricity since Thursday, when the southern coastal city was encircled by Russian forces.

The city’s mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said on Saturday that a cease-fire would allow for work to be done to restore critical infrastructure destroyed by Russian shelling.

A statement from the office of President Volodymyr Zelensky made no mention of whether people would be granted safe passage to leave, and it was unclear how the Ukrainians and the Russian forces in the area would coordinate to ensure that humanitarian assistance could be safely delivered.

The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that it was declaring a “cease-fire” starting at 10 a.m. Saturday, Moscow time. It also said that the Russian military was opening “humanitarian corridors” to allow civilians to leave the cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha. It was not immediately clear how the order would be implemented or whether it would apply to all of Ukraine.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation suspended reporting within Russia on Thursday, joining a growing list of news organizations. The government-owned broadcaster, which operates in both French and English, said in a statement that it is seeking “clarity” on recent Russian legislation “which appears to criminalize independent reporting on the current situation in Ukraine and Russia.”

Like other news organizations, including the BBC, the CBC said that the suspension was taken “out of concern for the risk to our journalists and staff in Russia.”

With Samsung following Apple in suspending all shipments to Russia, two companies that together account for about half of all smartphone sales in the country have now paused distribution to Russian buyers.

Samsung, the South Korean technology giant, made its announcement in a statement on Saturday. When Apple said this week that it was suspending sales in Russia, the company drew praise on Twitter from Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov.

The moves are part of a wider exodus of companies from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, one that has encompassed brands in automobiles, luxury retail and many other sectors.

For big technology firms, Russia is a relatively small cellphone market. Sales there account for less than 3 percent of all smartphone units shipped around the world, according to market research by the International Data Corporation.

But the recent moves by Apple and Samsung are enormously symbolic, said Michael S. Bernstam, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Among “people of all income groups and ethnic groups and cities and towns across Russia, they will know that their government received a slap in the face,” he said. “This is a very important message.”

Russian buyers will still be able to buy from the Chinese company Xiaomi, which sold just over a quarter of all smartphones in Russia in the third quarter of last year, according to I.D.C.

The lost sales in Russia are not much of a sacrifice for international smartphone manufacturers, but the potential reputational damage of continuing to sell there could be much more significant, said James S. O’Rourke, a professor of management at the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame.

“Your brand is judged in many ways by who buys it, who uses it, who you are in business with, who you are partners with,” he said. “You don’t want Vladimir Putin’s photo on your package.”

Singapore said on Saturday it would impose sanctions on Russia, including export controls on weapons, electronic and telecommunications and restrictions on financial activities by Russian banks.

“We will impose export controls on items that can be directly used as weapons to inflict harm on or to subjugate the Ukrainians, as well as items that can contribute to offensive cyber operations,” Singapore’s foreign ministry said in a statement. Is also announced “financial measures targeted at designated Russian banks, entities and activities in Russia, and fund-raising activities benefiting the Russian government.” It said it would prohibit digital payment service providers from enabling financial transactions from Russia and that its measures would apply to “all financial institutions in Singapore.”

Rabbi Labish Becker, the executive director of Agudath Israel of America, an umbrella organization of ultra-Orthodox Jewish groups, has raised more than $2 million for Ukraine since the Russian invasion . He said the emergence of President Volodymyr Zelensky , who is Jewish, as “a Ukrainian national hero” had been “a source of pride for people” amid the grim news of war.

“Everyone is sort of pinching themselves,” he said. “We just sit there and look at each other like: ‘Wow, this is amazing. It is like what J.F.K. said when he was in Berlin.’ We feel like, ‘We are all Ukrainians.’”

New York City is home to an estimated 300,000 Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and the largest single group of them are from Ukraine, according to Jewish leaders in the area. Many more Jewish Americans have ancestral ties to Ukraine, or a spiritual connection to the country as the birthplace of Hasidic Judaism.

Those ties, and the leadership of Mr. Zelensky, have produced in some American Jews a feeling of solidarity with Ukraine, a country that many of their ancestors fled. Many have become part of a robust fund-raising effort, rapidly assembled by Jewish groups in New York, which has produced millions of dollars in humanitarian aid.

The messaging app Telegram on Friday blocked the Russian state-controlled news network in Europe and the United States, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that tracks online extremism.

The move is notable because Telegram has been a main source of disinformation spreading in Russia and Ukraine, according to misinformation researchers. “False flag” rumors started by Russian officials to use as an excuse to invade Ukraine have circulated on anonymous Telegram channels, according to a recent report by the European Expert Association , a research group that focuses on security in Ukraine. Many of those channels are still live on the platform.

As they impose historic sanctions on Russia, the Biden administration and European governments have set new goals: devastate the Russian economy as punishment for the world to witness, and create domestic pressure on President Vladimir V. Putin to halt his war in Ukraine, current and former U.S. officials say.

The harsh penalties — which have hammered the ruble , shut down Russia’s stock market and prompted bank runs — contradict previous declarations by U.S. officials that they would refrain from inflicting pain on ordinary Russians. “We target them carefully to avoid even the appearance of targeting the average Russian civilian,” Daleep Singh, the deputy national security adviser for international economics, said at a White House briefing last month.

The thinking among some U.S. and European officials is that Mr. Putin might stop the war if enough Russians protest in the streets and enough tycoons turn on him. Other U.S. officials emphasize the goals of punishment and future deterrence, saying that the carcass of the Russian economy will serve as a visible consequence of Mr. Putin’s actions and a warning for other aggressors.

The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Friday in response to Russia’s attack and capture of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which caused worldwide alarm about the potential for a nuclear accident if the conflict in Ukraine is not contained.

The United States and its allies denounced Russia for the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, calling it a threat to civilians and a reckless escalation. They condemned the seizure of the plant and called for Russia to withdraw its troops from Zaporizhzhia and from the former Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine.

“By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,” said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “Mr. Putin must stop this madness, and he must stop it now. Cooler heads must prevail.”

Early on Friday, as fighting reached the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant, a fire started at a training building. The fire was extinguished, and the plant appeared to be safe on Friday. Ukrainian officials and the International Atomic Energy Agency said the fire had been contained without damage to the reactors or other equipment, and that radiation levels had not increased.

“This is the first time that a state has attacked a fueled and functioning nuclear power plant,” said Britain’s U.N. ambassador, Barbara Woodward, who had called for the Security Council meeting. “It must not happen again.”

Russia’s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, told the council that the allegations that Russia had attacked the nuclear site were “lies” and part of an anti-Russian campaign. He said the emergency meeting had been called to “kindle artificial hysteria about what is taking place in Ukraine.”

Mr. Nebenzya offered a different account of the incident, saying that Russian troops patrolling the area of the nuclear facility had come under fire from Ukrainian forces inside the training building and had returned fire. He accused Ukrainians of setting the blaze.

“Our servicemen are not interfering with the work of the operators of the power plants and only working to ensure stability,” Mr. Nebenzya said, adding that Russia had experienced the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and did not want to see another nuclear accident.

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, briefed the council from an airplane en route to Iran. Mr. Grossi said he had proposed to the Ukrainian and Russian authorities that he travel to Ukraine as soon as possible and visit both nuclear sites, Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia, to establish a framework to protect them.

Mr. Grossi said his mission would not be political and would be restricted to ensuring “the safety and security of nuclear establishments of Ukraine, which, as facts have shown, are in constant danger of accidents.” He added that the Zaporizhzhia facility was operating normally, but said he had informed the I.A.E.A. board of governors that “there is no normalcy to the situation when there are military forces in charge of the site.”

Beyond the statements of diplomats, the Security Council cannot take significant action against Russia because the country has veto power over legally binding resolutions. Russia vetoed a resolution last week that condemned its invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its troops.

The U.N. General Assembly, a 193-member body, passed a resolution on Wednesday that condemned the invasion and called for humanitarian access and a diplomatic solution. That resolution, which was politically symbolic but not legally binding, passed with 141 countries voting in favor, demonstrating Russia’s isolation on the world stage, diplomats said.

Russia voted against the measure, joined by Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria.

Zelensky criticizes NATO over its rejection of a no-fly zone.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine criticized NATO late Friday night over its rejection of a no-fly zone, hours after the alliance announced it would not intervene by air or land for fear of creating a conflict with Russia that could spill into other parts of Europe.

Leaders of the alliance met Friday in Brussels, after which NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said its members had rejected any possibility of intervening against Russian forces. Ukrainian officials had called for a no-fly zone, but NATO leaders have resisted, worried about a larger war. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, announcing the invasion last month, warned other countries against interfering.

“We have a responsibility as NATO allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine,” Mr. Stoltenberg said on Friday. “So we have made it clear that we are not going to move into Ukraine, neither on the ground or in Ukrainian airspace.”

Creating a no-fly zone over Ukraine would require deploying NATO fighter planes and possibly “shooting down Russian planes,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. That, he warned, could lead to “a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering.”

Mr. Zelensky, speaking in a video shared on social media, criticized that decision, calling the summit “weak” and “lost.” He said that Russian troops were shelling civilians, residential areas, churches and schools, and that the decision not to create a no-fly zone “gave a green light” to more bombardment.

“All the people who will die from this day will die because of you, as well,” he said, addressing NATO’s leaders. “Because of your weakness. Because of your disunity.”

Mr. Zelensky has used video speeches, many released late at night over social media, to try to rally Ukrainians as well as support from abroad. While he has celebrated the major sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union on Russia’s financial system and leaders, he has also repeatedly called on European leaders to provide additional military support.

About 20 countries, many of them members of NATO and the European Union, are funneling arms into Ukraine for its forces to use against Russia. NATO is also moving military equipment and as many as 22,000 more troops into member states bordering Russia and Belarus, to reassure them and enhance deterrence.

Several Western media organizations moved on Friday to suspend their journalistic operations in Russia in the wake of a harsh new crackdown on news and free speech by President Vladimir V. Putin ’s government.

Bloomberg News and the BBC said their correspondents in Russia could no longer freely report because of the new censorship law signed by Mr. Putin on Friday, which effectively criminalized independent journalism on the invasion of Ukraine . Under the legislation, which could take effect as early as Saturday, journalists who simply describe the war as a “war” could be sentenced to prison.

“The change to the criminal code, which seems designed to turn any independent reporter into a criminal purely by association, makes it impossible to continue any semblance of normal journalism inside the country,” Bloomberg’s editor in chief, John Micklethwait, wrote in a note to staff.

CNN International, the global arm of CNN, said it had stopped airing in Russia, and ABC News said that it would not broadcast from the country on Friday. “We will continue to assess the situation and determine what this means for the safety of our teams on the ground,” ABC News, which is based in New York, said in a statement.

News organizations are not necessarily asking their correspondents to leave Russia, at least not yet.

“We are not pulling out BBC News journalists from Moscow,” Jonathan Munro, the interim director of BBC News, wrote on Twitter . “We cannot use their reporting for the time being but they remain valued members of our teams and we hope to get them back on our output as soon as possible.”

He added: “Thoughts with colleagues in Moscow whose voices cannot be silenced for long.”

A spokeswoman for The New York Times had no immediate comment on Friday.

The censorship law builds on the Kremlin’s insistence that characterizations of its attacks on Ukraine as a “war” or “invasion” rather than a “special military operation” amount to disinformation. Its passage prompted several independent Russian media outlets to shut down their operations, as well.

Several foreign news outlets said their journalists in Ukraine would continue to report on the Russian invasion. This week, the BBC said it would use shortwave radio frequencies to broadcast news in Kyiv and in parts of Russia.

Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, accused the BBC of playing “a determined role in undermining the Russian stability and security.” Early on Friday, the BBC reported that access to its website in Russia appeared to be restricted.

Mr. Putin has been dismantling the last vestiges of a Russian free press. On Thursday, the pillars of Russia’s independent broadcast media collapsed under pressure from the state.

Echo of Moscow, the freewheeling radio station that was founded by Soviet dissidents in 1990 and symbolized Russia’s new freedoms, was “liquidated” by its board. TV Rain, the youthful independent television station that calls itself “the optimistic channel,” said it would suspend operations indefinitely.

And Dmitri A. Muratov, the journalist who shared the Nobel Peace Prize last year, said that his newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which survived the murders of six of its journalists, could be on the verge of shutting down as well.

Combat at a Ukrainian nuclear plant highlights the risk of a radioactive disaster from the Russian invasion.

LVIV, Ukraine — Russia captured Europe’s largest nuclear power plant before dawn on Friday in Ukraine, prompting questions about why it invaded the sprawling reactor site and the health risks to Ukrainians should combat at such sites lead to a nuclear disaster.

For the moment, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex seized on Friday appears safe, with the plant’s array of sensitive detectors finding no releases of radioactivity above the usual background levels.

The site, on the Dnieper River, not only has six reactors but acres of ponds where spent fuel rods are cooled. Experts fear that an errant shell or missile might set off an environmental disaster and, if a fire broke out, release clouds of radioactive particles that get carried by the wind around Europe.

“The thing you worry about is an ignorant soldier who is scared and fires off a rocket or a mortar that causes a calamity,” said David Albright , a physicist and president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a private group in Washington that tracks nuclear arms and matériel.

An accident of that nature could pose enormous dangers to Ukrainians and people in surrounding countries, including Russia. A threat of that kind emerged during Friday’s assault on facilities adjacent to the reactors at Zaporizhzhia.

The exchange of munitions was followed by a fire that was contained to a training building on the perimeter of the complex. A Russian shell hit the No. 1 reactor, but its thick walls allowed it to survive the blow, said Petro Kotin, the acting president of Energoatom, the state company that runs Ukraine’s nuclear energy facilities.

International observers and Ukrainian officials said that as of 6 a.m. on Friday, the complex was able to function safely. Mr. Kotin said that the Russian forces had allowed the nuclear plant’s operations to continue at a normal pace since they took over the complex.

Still, should an accident occur in which the reactor fuel overheats and melts the reactor’s core or shielding, it could be a repeat of the meltdowns that happened in 1979 at Three Mile Island near Harrisburg, Penn.; in 1986 at Chernobyl in Ukraine; and in 2011 at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan, experts say.

Further combat at Zaporizhzhia could pose an additional danger involving the site’s spent fuel rods, which contain up to roughly 30 tons of the high toxic metal plutonium, according to an estimate by Mr. Albright and two colleagues.

“Firing shells in the area of a nuclear power plant,” Rafael M. Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency said, “violates the fundamental principle” that seeks to maintain a nuclear site’s physical integrity at all times.

Speaking at an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting on Friday, Russia’s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, denied his country had purposely targeted the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex and challenged Ukrainian officials’ account that Russian troops attacked the plant and that the fire started as a result of the gun battle. He maintained that Russian forces patrolling outside of the nuclear plant had come under fire from Ukrainian militants inside the training building and had returned fire. He said the Ukrainians had then set the building on fire.

Experts said one possible motive for the Russian takeover of the Zaporizhzhia complex was the slow degradation of Ukraine’s power grid, which could throw nuclear power plants offline and result in cascading blackouts. “The Russians understand that energy is a massive tool of power,” said R. Scott Kemp , a professor of nuclear science at M.I.T. “It’s a point of tremendous leverage.”

A darker possibility relates to nuclear weapons manufacture. Russia may be motivated to seize Ukraine’s nuclear energy plants in part to gather atomic material for itself or to close off an unlikely and difficult path for Kyiv to acquire a nuclear weapon.

Photographers document Ukraine as panic grips some cities.

For weeks, a Russian invasion had been feared, but once the sweeping attacks began last week, hitting villages, towns and cities all over northern, southern and eastern Ukraine, the war became unavoidably tangible for its people, a hovering cloud of darkness that once seemed unimaginable in the post-Cold War era.

As Ukrainian forces waged intense battles for Kyiv, the capital, Kharkiv and other major cities, people waited to see what might come of an escalating war, sputtering diplomacy and Western sanctions against Russia. Photographers with The New York Times and other news organizations are throughout Ukraine, providing a look at how people are coping with the uncertainty and fear of a military invasion.

Sixteen days earlier, Oleksandr Abramenko was in China, celebrating his silver medal — the only medal of any kind won by Ukraine at the Beijing Winter Games.

Abramenko, a top aerialist in freestyle skiing, a five-time Olympian and the country’s flag-bearer for the opening ceremony, garnered more attention after the event, when a photograph of his hug with a Russian rival was widely circulated.

On Friday night in Kyiv, Abramenko, 33, was in the parking garage of his apartment building with his wife, Alexandra, and their 2-year-old son, Dmitry.

Thousands of people have been attempting to flee the city, leading to large crowds and chaos at Kyiv’s main train station as Ukraine’s military said that the Russian army’s primary objective was to encircle the capital.

It was their seventh night sleeping in the garage, believing it to be safer than their 20th-floor apartment above, not far from the city’s major airport.

“We spend the night in the underground parking in the car, because the air attack siren is constantly on,” Abramenko wrote during the exchange. “It’s scary to sleep in the apartment, I myself saw from the window how the air defense systems worked on enemy missiles, and strong explosions were heard.”

By Friday, amid the scramble to abandon Kyiv, Abramenko knew it was time to leave, headed for some unknown future. The family planned to drive on Saturday to the western edge of Ukraine, near the borders of Slovakia and Hungary. In the best of times, it could take 10 hours.

“I plan to go to my coach, Enver Ablaev , he lives in Mukachevo, Transcarpathian region,” Abramenko said. “I go by car, I take essential things with me, food, and my Olympic medals.”

Beyond his newly minted silver medal, Abramenko won a gold medal in 2018.

The small world of aerials is trying to provide comfort. Athletes from Switzerland, including the former Olympic freestyle skier Andreas Isoz, have been raising funds and planned to go this weekend to Mukachevo, or as close as they could get near the Ukrainian border, to hand off supplies.

Abramenko is not sure what the coming days will bring. He is worried for his parents, who live in Mykolaiv, a port city on the Black Sea where Abramenko was raised. It sits between the occupied city of Kherson and Odessa, expected to be a key target of the Russians.

“Fighting is already underway in Nikolaev,” Abramenko wrote, using an alternate spelling for the city. “My parents are sitting at home and hearing explosions. It is dangerous to leave Nikolaev at the moment, they want to be there. Might be able to leave later.”

Abramenko’s quest is to get to Mukachevo “to think about my next steps.” He is unsure if his wife and son will head across the border as refugees, like more than a million other Ukrainians. He just knows that, like all men his age, he cannot leave Ukraine.

“I don’t know if I’ll go to war or not, I don’t know what process the guys who are being called up are going through,” he wrote. “At the moment, our army is fully coping with the offensives of Russian soldiers and equipment.”

After a couple of hours of sporadic messaging, the replies from Abramenko in Kyiv stopped. It was close to midnight there.

War has helped ease the post-Brexit rift between Britain and the E.U.

LONDON — It took the invasion of a sovereign nation, the bombardment of its cities and the continent’s biggest security challenge in decades to make it happen. But for the first time in years, Britain and the European Union, estranged following the acrimony of Brexit, are working together again

On Friday, Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, attended a meeting of European Union ministers in Brussels to discuss the crisis in Ukraine , a move that, before Britain left the bloc, would have been routine, but one that now underscores a striking rapprochement.

In the poisonous aftermath of Britain’s exit from the E .U., the relationship between the two sides degenerated into discord, distrust and open sniping.

But confronted with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine , and resulting issues that are several orders of magnitude graver than rifts over fishing rights or the movement of sausages , the chasm opened up by Brexit is beginning to narrow.

“In the two years I have been here, I don’t think I have seen such intensity and quality in our relationship as I have in the last two weeks,” said João Vale de Almeida, the European Union’s ambassador to Britain. Ms. Truss’s attendance at the Brussels meeting was “very meaningful and symbolic,” he added.

The new mood of cooperation points to the possibility that, after years of division and feuding, the two sides might be starting to put Brexit behind them. When asked about the significance of Ms. Truss’s visit to Brussels, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said that it showed that Britain was working very closely with European partners. He added: “What we have been able to demonstrate to Putin is a strength of unity on this, moving with purpose.”

Since Russia began its invasion more than a week ago, Britain has moved in step with the European Union, the United States and other allies to introduce sanctions intended to cripple the Russian economy, and analysts have noted the changed atmosphere.

Almost six wearying years after Britain voted to leave the European Union , even the most hardened Brexit supporter knows that Moscow is a bigger threat than Brussels, and even the most hostile critics of Britain in Europe understand that sanctions against Russia work better with British economic heft behind them.

Nevertheless, Ms. Truss’s decision seemed to surprise some in Britain, generating a headline in the Daily Express newspaper , a pro-Brexit champion, that read: “U.K. back in Brussels!”

Switzerland imposes sanctions on Russia, breaking with tradition of neutrality.

GENEVA — Switzerland targeted Russia with sweeping financial and business sanctions on Friday over its invasion of Ukraine. The new measures were in addition to sanctions announced four days ago that broke with the country’s long tradition of neutrality and fell in line with action taken by the European Union.

The government said it was freezing the assets of individuals listed by the European Union who were closely connected to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. It also banned transactions with Russia’s central bank and instituted measures to cut off Russian financial institutions from the SWIFT financial messaging system as part of an effort by the United States and its European allies to sever Russia from the international banking system.

Switzerland also banned exports to Russia of dual-use technology that could have military or security applications. It halted supply of some goods and services to the oil industry and exports of technology used in the aviation and space industries. It also banned a range of services for these sectors, including insurance and repair.

A statement from the Swiss government insisted its actions were compatible with its policy of neutrality and that it did not intend its actions to interfere with any humanitarian activities.

The sanctions were not well received by Russia.

“We’re disappointed with this,” Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Gennady Gatilov, told reporters.

More than a million Ukrainians have fled to neighboring countries as the war intensifies and Russia gains ground. Many of them, including a young girl, top left, have escaped through a border crossing into Medyka, Poland . Once over the border, they wait in Medyka, top right, for buses to transport them to their next destination.

In Przemysl, Poland, about a 20-minute drive west of Medyka, a former Tesco supermarket has become an unofficial meeting place for the refugees. There, they listen to updates, bottom left, and wait for transportation, bottom right.

Luxury giants LVMH and Hermès will close stores in Russia temporarily.

The French luxury giants LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Hermès each said Friday that they would temporarily close their stores in Russia as the crisis in Ukraine continued to escalate .

LVMH, which is estimated to have more than 120 stores in Russia, said that it would close them effective Sunday “given the current circumstances in the region,” according to a spokesperson. The spokesperson added that the company would continue to pay salary and benefits to its 3,500 employees in the country. Hermès said in a LinkedIn post that it would temporarily close its stores and pause commercial activity in Russia as of Friday evening.

“Deeply concerned by the situation in Europe at this time, it’s with regret that we have taken the decision to temporarily close our stores in Russia and pause all our commercial activities,” Hermès said in the post.

Western retailers like Ikea, H&M Group and Nike have made announcements about halting sales and temporarily closing stores in Russia in recent days and expressed their support for the people of Ukraine. Most have said that they will continue to pay their Russian employees. In addition to the escalating violence in Ukraine, retailers are responding to the broader trade disruption in Russia and the sanctions aimed at financial transactions in the country.

Ikea, which is based in Stockholm, said this week that it would pause exports and imports to and from Russia and Belarus, halt retail operations and pause operations of its unit that produces wooden furniture. The company told The New York Times in an email on Friday, “Due to current international sanctions, and the intentions thereof, we are not making transactions, including payments in and out of Russia or Belarus.”

“The sanctions regime affecting Russia is quickly evolving as countries coordinate on and deploy an array of targeted financial and trade sanctions,” Steve Lamar, president and chief executive of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said in a statement. “Among those affecting retail, and their workers, are restrictions on financial institutions and financial flows, such as wage payments.”
