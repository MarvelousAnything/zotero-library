 Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces shelled Europe’s largest nuclear plant 
early Friday, sparking a fire as they pressed their attack on a crucial 
energy-producing Ukrainian city and gained ground in their bid to cut 
off the country from the sea.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Leading
 nuclear authorities were concerned — but not panicked — about the 
damage to the power station. The assault triggered phone calls between 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Joe Biden and
 other world leaders. The U.S. Department of Energy activated its 
nuclear incident response team as a precaution.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 attack on the eastern city of Enerhodar and its Zaporizhzhia nuclear 
plant unfolded as the invasion entered its second week and another round
 of talks between the two sides yielded a tentative agreement to set up 
safe corridors to evacuate citizens and deliver humanitarian aid.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Nuclear
 plant spokesman Andriy Tuz told Ukrainian television that shells were 
falling directly on the facility and had set fire to one of its six 
reactors. That reactor is under renovation and not operating, but there 
is nuclear fuel inside, he said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Firefighters
 cannot get near the flames because they are being shot at, he said, and
 Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted a plea to the Russians
 to stop the assault and allow fire teams inside.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“We
 demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire,” Tuz said in a video 
statement. “There is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest 
atomic energy station in Europe.”</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-75"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-33">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-36"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-34"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle1" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-32"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 assault renewed fears that the invasion could damage one of Ukraine’s 
15 nuclear reactors and set off another emergency like the 1986 
Chernobyl accident, the world’s worst nuclear disaster, which happened 
about 110 kilometers (65 miles) north of the capital.</p><div data-key="media-placeholder"><div class="YoutubeEmbed youtubeEmbed"><div class="vertical-wrapper"><div class="vertical-limit"></div><img alt="ratio" class="ratio" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAAAAAAeQfPuAAAAC0lEQVQYGWMYrAAAAJkAAWzZLOIAAAAASUVORK5CIIA="></div><div class="horizontal-limit"></div><div class="youtube-player" id="youtube-wrapper-CdQCvVLjhiY-article"><img class="thumbnail" src="" alt="Youtube video thumbnail"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">U.S.
 Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted that the Zaporizhzhia 
plant’s reactors were protected by robust containment structures and 
were being safely shut down.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">In
 an emotional speech in the middle of the night, Zelenskyy said he 
feared an explosion that would be “the end for everyone. The end for 
Europe. The evacuation of Europe.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“Only
 urgent action by Europe can stop the Russian troops,” he said. “Do not 
allow the death of Europe from a catastrophe at a nuclear power 
station.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">But most experts saw nothing to indicate an impending disaster.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 International Atomic Energy Agency said the fire had not affected 
essential equipment and that Ukraine’s nuclear regulator reported no 
change in radiation levels. The American Nuclear Society concurred, 
saying that the latest radiation levels remained within natural 
background levels.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“The
 real threat to Ukrainian lives continues to be the violent invasion and
 bombing of their country,” the group said in a statement.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Jon
 Wolfsthal, who served during the Obama administration as the senior 
director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security 
Council, said the plant’s reactors have thick concrete containment domes
 that should protect them from tank and artillery fire.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-75"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-33">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-36"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-34"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle2" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-32"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">But
 he too was concerned about a potential loss of power at the plant, 
which could imperil its ability to keep the nuclear fuel cool.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 mayor of Enerhodar said earlier that Ukrainian forces were battling 
Russian troops on the city’s outskirts. Video showed flames and black 
smoke rising above the city of more than 50,000, with people streaming 
past wrecked cars.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Prior
 to the shelling, the Ukrainian state atomic energy company reported 
that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant. 
Loud shots and rocket fire were heard late Thursday.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“Many
 young men in athletic clothes and armed with Kalashnikovs have come 
into the city. They are breaking down doors and trying to get into the 
apartments of local residents,” the statement from Energoatom said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Later,
 a livestreamed security camera linked from the homepage of the 
Zaporizhzhia plant showed what appeared to be armored vehicles rolling 
into the facility’s parking lot and shining spotlights on the building 
where the camera was mounted.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Then
 there were what appeared to be muzzle flashes from vehicles, followed 
by nearly simultaneous explosions in surrounding buildings. Smoke rose 
into the frame and drifted away.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Ukrainian
 Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal called on the West to close the skies over
 the country’s nuclear plants. “It is a question of the security of the 
whole world!” he said in a statement.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 U.S. and NATO allies have ruled out creating a no-fly zone since the 
move would pit Russian and Western military forces against each other.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Vladimir
 Putin’s forces have brought their superior firepower to bear over the 
past few days, launching hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on 
cities and other sites around the country and making significant gains 
in the south.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 Russians announced the capture of the southern city of Kherson, a vital
 Black Sea port of 280,000, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed the 
takeover of the government headquarters there, making it the first major
 city to fall since <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-united-nations-general-assembly-volodymyr-zelenskyy-soccer-sports-7456cc05797d72960257a8ac75654d98">the invasion began a week ago</a><!-- -->.</p><div class="Component-hubPeekEmbed-0-2-79 HubPeek noBorderBottom-0-2-98 compressedEmbed-0-2-99"><div data-key="feed-card-hub-peak" class="hubPeekContainerWide-0-2-101"><div class="title-0-2-102"><a class="blueTitle-0-2-103 blueTitle-1-0-2-110 overrideArticle" href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"><h3 class="title-0-2-102">Russia-Ukraine war</h3></a></div><div class="columnLayout-0-2-107"><li class="wireStoryContainer-0-2-112 noImage-0-2-113"><div class="titleContainer-0-2-115"><a class="title-0-2-116 overrideArticle" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-business-europe-5b306e611d2a7fc3d20165a54cf38062"><h4 class="headline-0-2-119">Russia-Ukraine war: Key things to know about the conflict</h4></a></div></li><li class="wireStoryContainer-0-2-112 noImage-0-2-113"><div class="titleContainer-0-2-115"><a class="title-0-2-116 overrideArticle" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-poland-crime-war-crimes-29178de14c7e444cf907d192614f1ddb"><h4 class="headline-0-2-119">'They were shooting civilians': Ukraine refugees saw abuses</h4></a></div></li><div class="divider-0-2-105"></div><div class="divider-0-2-105"></div><li class="wireStoryContainer-0-2-112 noImage-0-2-113"><div class="titleContainer-0-2-115"><a class="title-0-2-116 overrideArticle" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-bf2bcfb3a499d688e3075f2d4cf54989"><h4 class="headline-0-2-119">Russians keep pressure on Mariupol after hospital attack</h4></a></div></li><li class="wireStoryContainer-0-2-112 noImage-0-2-113"><div class="titleContainer-0-2-115"><a class="title-0-2-116 overrideArticle" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-boris-johnson-soccer-sports-business-10e0451911b5a2079e1dbbd6e71cc1c2"><h4 class="headline-0-2-119">EXPLAINER: What sanctions mean for Roman Abramovich, Chelsea</h4></a></div></li></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Heavy
 fighting continued on the outskirts of another strategic port, 
Mariupol, on the Azov Sea. The battles have knocked out the city’s 
electricity, heat and water systems, as well as most phone service, 
officials said. Food deliveries to the city were also cut.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Associated
 Press video from the port city showed the assault lighting up the 
darkening sky above deserted streets and medical teams treating 
civilians, including a 16-year-old boy inside a clinic who could not be 
saved. The child was playing soccer when he was wounded in the shelling,
 according to his father, who cradled the boy’s head on the gurney and 
cried.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Severing 
Ukraine’s access to the Black and Azov seas would deal a crippling blow 
to its economy and allow Russia to build a land corridor to Crimea, 
seized by Moscow in 2014.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Overall,
 the outnumbered, outgunned Ukrainians have put up stiff resistance, 
staving off the swift victory that Russia appeared to have expected. But
 a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said Russia’s seizure of Crimea gave it a logistical advantage in that 
part of the country, with shorter supply lines that smoothed the 
offensive there.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Ukrainian
 leaders called on the people to defend their homeland by cutting down 
trees, erecting barricades in the cities and attacking enemy columns 
from the rear. In recent days, authorities have issued weapons to 
civilians and taught them how to make Molotov cocktails.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“Total
 resistance. ... This is our Ukrainian trump card, and this is what we 
can do best in the world,” Oleksiy Arestovich, an aide to Zelenskyy, 
said in a video message, recalling guerrilla actions in Nazi-occupied 
Ukraine during World War II.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 second round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations was 
held in neighboring Belarus. But the two sides appeared far apart going 
into the meeting, and Putin warned Ukraine that it must quickly accept 
the Kremlin’s demand for its “demilitarization” and declare itself 
neutral, renouncing its bid to join NATO.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Putin
 told French President Emmanuel Macron he was determined to press on 
with his attack “until the end,” according to Macron’s office.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 two sides said that they tentatively agreed to allow cease-fires in 
areas designated safe corridors, and that they would seek to work out 
the necessary details quickly. A Zelenskyy adviser also said a third 
round of talks will be held early next week.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Despite
 a profusion of evidence of civilian casualties and destruction of 
property by the Russian military, Putin decried what he called an 
“anti-Russian disinformation campaign” and insisted that Moscow uses 
“only precision weapons to exclusively destroy military infrastructure.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Putin
 claimed that the Russian military had already offered safe corridors 
for civilians to flee, but he asserted without evidence that Ukrainian 
“neo-Nazis” were preventing people from leaving and were using them as 
human shields.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">He
 also hailed Russian soldiers as heroes in a video call with members of 
Russia’s Security Council, and ordered additional payments to families 
of men killed or wounded.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 Pentagon set up a direct communication link to Russia’s Ministry of 
Defense earlier this week to avoid the possibility of a miscalculation 
sparking conflict between Moscow and Washington, according to a U.S. 
defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the link 
had not been announced.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Karmanau

Compressed layout (automatic embed)\u003c/div>\u003cp>Chelsea has won five Premier League titles under Abramovich along with two Champions League titles, the latest last year. Victory in the Club World Cup last month completed the set of major honors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The success has been funded by around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) of loans to the club that Abramovich said he didn't want repaid when putting the club up for sale last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHY SANCTION ABRAMOVICH?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich has used legal means to try to publicly distance himself from benefiting from an association with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The British government thinks otherwise, saying Abramovich has obtained “a financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the government of Russia,\" including tax breaks, the sale of shares at favorable rates, and contracts in the buildup to Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich “is or has been involved in destabilizing Ukraine” via Evraz, a steel manufacturing and mining company which he effectively controls and has potentially supplied the Russia military, the government said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His fortune was made in oil and aluminium following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2005, Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom paid $13 billion for the Sibneft oil company controlled by Abramovich. It allowed Putin’s Kremlin to recapture state influence in the lucrative energy industry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON CHELSEA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The sanctions could have immediately forced Chelsea to stop running as a business, and preventing its teams from completing their seasons. Instead, a special license has been issued to allow it to continue operating, subject to heavy restrictions.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Only fans already with tickets — mainly season ticket holders — can attend matches, shutting out away fans from games. The club's shop had to close on Thursday morning. Staff at the hotel built onto Stamford Bridge said they were under orders to no longer accept new reservations or sell food and drink.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Only 500,000 pounds ($657,000) can be spent on staging each match at Stamford Bridge, including on security and catering. A maximum of 20,000 pounds can be spent on travel to matches. Chelsea plays in France at Lille in the Champions League next week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Player recruitment is also prohibited under the terms of the government license that runs through May 31. There are players with contracts expiring at the end of the season in June and the sanctions create uncertainty over whether Cesar Azpilicueta, Toni Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen could be offered new deals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>CAN CHELSEA STILL BE SOLD?\u003c/p>\u003cp>As calls grew in the British parliament for Abramovich to be sanctioned, Chelsea was put up for sale.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated,” Abramovich said. “The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>It gave the impression of being an entity that Abramovich would be involved with. The foundation could have benefited Russian victims, too.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chelsea sought potential bidders to register their interest by next week. But now the government has oversight of the process.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“While the current license does not permit the sale of the club at this time, the government is open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a new license to allow for a sale,” the government said. “Proceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"BorisJohnson","name":"Boris Johnson","canonicalName":"boris-johnson","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-sports","name":"Sports","canonicalName":"sports","isPr":false},{"id":"Soccer","name":"Soccer","canonicalName":"soccer","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-EuropeanSports","name":"Sports - Europe","canonicalName":"sports-europe","isPr":false},{"id":"London","name":"London","canonicalName":"london","isPr":false},{"id":"PremierLeague","name":"Premier League","canonicalName":"premier-league","isPr":false},{"id":"RomanAbramovich","name":"Roman Abramovich","canonicalName":"roman-abramovich","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null}],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":"Russia-Ukraine","hubPeekTagName":"Russia-Ukraine war","hubPeekCanonicalName":"russia-ukraine","hubPeekIsPr":false,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"Column List","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":"Compressed","endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null}},"loadedAt":{"afs:Card:393483284474":1646952610579},"expiration":120000},"content":{"loading":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:a3092d8e476949ed7c55607a645a9154":false},"error":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:a3092d8e476949ed7c55607a645a9154":null},"data":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:a3092d8e476949ed7c55607a645a9154":{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:a3092d8e476949ed7c55607a645a9154","shortId":"a3092d8e476949ed7c55607a645a9154","etag":"a3092d8e476949ed7c55607a645a9154_37a8aza0c0","bylines":"By JIM HEINTZ, YURAS KARMANAU and MSTYSLAV CHERNOV","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces shelled Europe’s largest nuclear plant early Friday, sparking a fire as they pressed their attack on a crucial energy-producing Ukrainian city and gained ground in their bid to cut off the country from the sea.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"Russia attacks Ukraine nuclear plant as invasion advances","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"3e337ed2de3c4283b10663b8caad6ab7","leadVideoId":"14fd23157382478bbfdd0b60e8f265f5","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/a3092d8e476949ed7c55607a645a9154","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"525b3917faee4555b582f63d58ec02cf","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>Serhii, father of teenager Iliya, cries on his son's lifeless body lying on a stretcher at a maternity hospital converted into a medical ward in Mariupol, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 2, 2022.

a fire as they pressed their attack on a crucial energy-producing Ukrainian city and gained ground in their bid to cut off the country from the sea.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Leading nuclear authorities were concerned — but not panicked — about the damage to the power station. The assault triggered phone calls between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Joe Biden and other world leaders. The U.S. Department of Energy activated its nuclear incident response team as a precaution.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The attack on the eastern city of Enerhodar and its Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant unfolded as the invasion entered its second week and another round of talks between the two sides yielded a tentative agreement to set up safe corridors to evacuate citizens and deliver humanitarian aid.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nuclear plant spokesman Andriy Tuz told Ukrainian television that shells were falling directly on the facility and had set fire to one of its six reactors. That reactor is under renovation and not operating, but there is nuclear fuel inside, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Firefighters cannot get near the flames because they are being shot at, he said, and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted a plea to the Russians to stop the assault and allow fire teams inside.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire,” Tuz said in a video statement. “There is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The assault renewed fears that the invasion could damage one of Ukraine's 15 nuclear reactors and set off another emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world’s worst nuclear disaster, which happened about 110 kilometers (65 miles) north of the capital.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='14fd23157382478bbfdd0b60e8f265f5' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted that the Zaporizhzhia plant’s reactors were protected by robust containment structures and were being safely shut down.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In an emotional speech in the middle of the night, Zelenskyy said he feared an explosion that would be \"the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Only urgent action by Europe can stop the Russian troops,\" he said. \"Do not allow the death of Europe from a catastrophe at a nuclear power station.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But most experts saw nothing to indicate an impending disaster.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The International Atomic Energy Agency said the fire had not affected essential equipment and that Ukraine’s nuclear regulator reported no change in radiation levels. The American Nuclear Society concurred, saying that the latest radiation levels remained within natural background levels.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The real threat to Ukrainian lives continues to be the violent invasion and bombing of their country,” the group said in a statement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jon Wolfsthal, who served during the Obama administration as the senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, said the plant's reactors have thick concrete containment domes that should protect them from tank and artillery fire.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But he too was concerned about a potential loss of power at the plant, which could imperil its ability to keep the nuclear fuel cool.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The mayor of Enerhodar said earlier that Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city’s outskirts. Video showed flames and black smoke rising above the city of more than 50,000, with people streaming past wrecked cars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Prior to the shelling, the Ukrainian state atomic energy company reported that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant. Loud shots and rocket fire were heard late Thursday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Many young men in athletic clothes and armed with Kalashnikovs have come into the city. They are breaking down doors and trying to get into the apartments of local residents,” the statement from Energoatom said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Later, a livestreamed security camera linked from the homepage of the Zaporizhzhia plant showed what appeared to be armored vehicles rolling into the facility’s parking lot and shining spotlights on the building where the camera was mounted.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Then there were what appeared to be muzzle flashes from vehicles, followed by nearly simultaneous explosions in surrounding buildings. Smoke rose into the frame and drifted away.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal called on the West to close the skies over the country's nuclear plants. \"It is a question of the security of the whole world!” he said in a statement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. and NATO allies have ruled out creating a no-fly zone since the move would pit Russian and Western military forces against each other.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Vladimir Putin’s forces have brought their superior firepower to bear over the past few days, launching hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites around the country and making significant gains in the south.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Russians announced the capture of the southern city of Kherson, a vital Black Sea port of 280,000, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed the takeover of the government headquarters there, making it the first major city to fall since \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-united-nations-general-assembly-volodymyr-zelenskyy-soccer-sports-7456cc05797d72960257a8ac75654d98\">the invasion began a week ago\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Card:393483284474\" class=\"hub-peek-embed\">Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout \u003c/div>\u003cp>Heavy fighting continued on the outskirts of another strategic port, Mariupol, on the Azov Sea. The battles have knocked out the city's electricity, heat and water systems, as well as most phone service, officials said. Food deliveries to the city were also cut.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press video from the port city showed the assault lighting up the darkening sky above deserted streets and medical teams treating civilians, including a 16-year-old boy inside a clinic who could not be saved. The child was playing soccer when he was wounded in the shelling, according to his father, who cradled the boy’s head on the gurney and cried.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Severing Ukraine's access to the Black and Azov seas would deal a crippling blow to its economy and allow Russia to build a land corridor to Crimea, seized by Moscow in 2014.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Overall, the outnumbered, outgunned Ukrainians have put up stiff resistance, staving off the swift victory that Russia appeared to have expected. But a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russia’s seizure of Crimea gave it a logistical advantage in that part of the country, with shorter supply lines that smoothed the offensive there.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ukrainian leaders called on the people to defend their homeland by cutting down trees, erecting barricades in the cities and attacking enemy columns from the rear. In recent days, authorities have issued weapons to civilians and taught them how to make Molotov cocktails.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Total resistance. ... This is our Ukrainian trump card, and this is what we can do best in the world,” Oleksiy Arestovich, an aide to Zelenskyy, said in a video message, recalling guerrilla actions in Nazi-occupied Ukraine during World War II.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The second round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations was held in neighboring Belarus. But the two sides appeared far apart going into the meeting, and Putin warned Ukraine that it must quickly accept the Kremlin's demand for its “demilitarization\" and declare itself neutral, renouncing its bid to join NATO.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron he was determined to press on with his attack \"until the end,” according to Macron's office.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The two sides said that they tentatively agreed to allow cease-fires in areas designated safe corridors, and that they would seek to work out the necessary details quickly. A Zelenskyy adviser also said a third round of talks will be held early next week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Despite a profusion of evidence of civilian casualties and destruction of property by the Russian military, Putin decried what he called an “anti-Russian disinformation campaign” and insisted that Moscow uses “only precision weapons to exclusively destroy military infrastructure.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Putin claimed that the Russian military had already offered safe corridors for civilians to flee, but he asserted without evidence that Ukrainian “neo-Nazis\" were preventing people from leaving and were using them as human shields.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He also hailed Russian soldiers as heroes in a video call with members of Russia's Security Council, and ordered additional payments to families of men killed or wounded.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Pentagon set up a direct communication link to Russia's Ministry of Defense earlier this week to avoid the possibility of a miscalculation sparking conflict between Moscow and Washington, according to a U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the link had not been announced.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Karmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.
