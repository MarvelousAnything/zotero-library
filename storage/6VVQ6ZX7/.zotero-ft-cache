Abstract

In this article we elaborate on the structure of the generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) form for nonlinear differential equations. We discuss here the algebraic properties of the GLV family, such as the invariance under quasimonomial transformations and the underlying structure of classes of equivalence. Each class possesses a unique representative under the classical quadratic Lotka-Volterra form. We show how other standard modeling forms of biological interest, such as S-systems or mass-action systems, are naturally embedded into the GLV form, which thus provides a formal framework for their comparison and for the establishment of transformation rules. We also focus on the issue of recasting of general nonlinear systems into the GLV format. We present a procedure for doing so and point at possible sources of ambiguity that could make the resulting Lotka-Volterra system dependent on the path followed. We then provide some general theorems that define the operational and algorithmic framework in which this is not the case.

    In a recent paper , completely integrable cases were discovered of the Lotka Volterra Hamiltonian (LVH) system without linear terms, , , satisfying the condition . In this paper, we first generalize this system to one that includes an arbitrary set of linear terms that preserve the Hamiltonian integral. We thus discover a wide class of LVH systems which we claim to be integrable, since their equations possess the Painlevé property, i.e. their solutions have only poles as movable singularities in the complex -plane. Next, we focus on the case and vary some of the parameters, including additional nonlinearities to look for nonintegrable extensions with interesting dynamical properties. Our results suggest that, in this class of systems, non - integrability generally yields simple dynamics far removed from the type of complexity one expects from non - integrable 3 - dimensional nonlinear systems.
