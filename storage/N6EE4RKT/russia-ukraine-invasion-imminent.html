The worsening Ukraine-Russia crisis could push it even higher.\n\nThat's because the conflict is threatening to send oil prices above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, according to RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas. Oil prices already surged to a fresh eight-year high on Tuesday after Moscow ordered troops into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, with Brent crude, the global benchmark, hitting $97.63.\n\nA war in Europe – which many foreign policy experts say is a real possibility – could cause oil prices to climb as much as 20% to $120 a barrel, Brusuelas estimated. Should that happen, consumer prices in the U.S. would surge above 10% on an annual basis, the economist said, the highest since October 1981. \n\n\"The potential for a broader energy shock to the global and U.S. economies should Russia invade Ukraine has added to a combustible mix of factors that is causing inflation to accelerate in the United States and abroad,\" Brusuelas said. \"That risk

That's because the conflict is threatening to send oil prices above $100
 a barrel for the first time since 2014, according to RSM chief 
economist Joe Brusuelas. Oil prices already surged to a fresh eight-year
 high on Tuesday after Moscow ordered troops into two breakaway regions 
in eastern Ukraine, with Brent crude, the global benchmark, hitting 
$97.63.</p><p>A war in Europe – which many foreign policy experts say is
 a real possibility – could cause oil prices to climb as much as 20% to 
$120 a barrel, Brusuelas estimated. Should that happen, consumer prices 
in the U.S. would surge above 10% on an annual basis, the economist 
said, the highest since October 1981.&nbsp;</p><p>"The potential for a broader energy shock to the global and U.S. economies should <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia" target="_blank" data-omtr-intcmp="lb_russia-ukraine:-biden-announces-sanctions,-troop-movements-in-response-to-invasion:-live-updates_postclickthru_29_article3 ">
Russia</a> invade Ukraine has added to a combustible mix of factors that
 is causing inflation to accelerate in the United States and abroad," 
Brusuelas said. "That risk carries with it the potential to slow down
