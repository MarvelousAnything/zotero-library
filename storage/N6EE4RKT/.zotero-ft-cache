Obama's Director of National Intelligence James Clapper: I wish we were more aggressive in 2014

Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said that he wished the Obama administration had done more to punish Russia for invading and annexing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 on "The Lead with Jake Tapper" Tuesday.

Tensions are broiling between the West and Moscow amid the former Soviet country's decision to recognize and roll into a separatist region in Eastern Ukraine. President Biden said during a press briefing Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin was beginning an "invasion." He said the stockpiles of blood on the Ukrainian border were an imminent sign of aggressive military intentions. "You don’t need blood unless you plan on starting a war," Biden said.

Attack helicopters and F-35s moved to Europe amid Ukraine crisis

The U.S. military is moving more troops and equipment to Europe as tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue to escalate.

The military is moving F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and a battalion of 20 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters from Germany, as well as 800 soldiers from Italy, to Baltic states and Poland in an attempt to reinforce NATO's eastern flank, according to reporting from Task & Purpose.

President Biden on Tuesday stressed that the additional troop movements were defensive in nature, making clear her did not intend to send the U.S. military into an armed confrontation with Russia.

“Today, in response to Russia’s admission that it will not withdraw its forces from Belarus, I have authorized additional movement of U.S. forces and equipment already stationed in Europe, to strengthen our Baltic allies: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania," Biden said.

US military firepower rushing to Ukraine as besieged nation faces Russian invasion

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said President Biden promised his country more weapons from the U.S. for its bid to fight off a Russian invasion.

Asked by Fox News' Bret Baier if his meetings with Biden Tuesday resulted in a promise of more U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine, Kuleba said, "Yes," before noting that such guarantees should be moved on quickly given the uncertainties around Russia's intentions. 

"The problem is we that we don't have a clear understanding of Putin's timeline… how he planned his further actions, neither here in Washington nor back in Kyiv," Kuleba said. "So the only solution that we have under these circumstances is to act as swiftly as we can."

White House expects Putin to continue escalating conflict with Ukraine

White House press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the administration is still hoping for a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine but expects Russia to continue to escalate the conflict.

"President Putin attacked Ukraine's right to exist" in his Monday speech, Psaki said. "He has explicitly threatened war unless his extreme demands are met. He gave an entire speech selling a war to the Russian people. Our expectation... is that he will continue to take escalatory actions and further invade the country."

White House doesn't close the door on Nord Stream 2 coming back online

White House Press secretary Jen Psaki did not rule out the possibility that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline come come back online after reaching an agreement with Germany to tank the project in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine.

Asked by Fox News' Hillary Vaughn if she could rule out the possibility that Biden would allow the project to proceed in the future, Psaki would only say that Biden has "never" been supportive of the pipeline and that it was never operational before the punitive measures taken by the U.S. and Germany Tuesday.

Psaki said the president has "always criticized" the pipeline "as a project that we didn't support," noting that the sanctions issued "make that very clear."

White House says this 'isn't the right time' to meet with Putin

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said meetings with Russian leaders cannot take place as long as Russia continues to escalate the conflict with Ukraine.

Asked if President Biden would be open to a diplomatic meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Paski said "this isn't the time" for such a meeting, arguing that Russia would be required to deescalate the situation in Ukraine before any meeting could take place.

Psaki said that the president is always "open" to conversations "leader to leader,", but made clear such a meeting cannot take play as Putin is "overseeing the invasion of a sovereign country."

The remarks come after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called off a planned Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, arguing such a meeting would "not make sense" amid Russia's current actions in Ukraine.

US, Europe prepare for possible refugee wave out of Ukraine

U.S. and European officials are preparing for a possible refugee wave out of  Ukraine should Russia move forward with a full invasion of the Eastern European country – raising fears of a crisis that could eclipse the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis.

"If [Putin] employs that kind of combat power, it will certainly create enormous casualties within the civilian population and so this could create a … tragedy, quite frankly, in terms of refugee flow and displaced people," Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on ABC News on Sunday. "So this is potentially very, very dangerous."

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday announced that he was recognizing two breakaway territories in Ukraine and followed it up with a deployment of troops that the White House has described as an "invasion." 

European countries have been warning for weeks that a flood of Ukrainian refugees could soon follow any invasion by Russia, raising fears of a flood of people that could cause knock-on effects in nearby countries and the continent as a whole. Those fears are shared by American officials.

European Union: Approved sanctions are going to hurt Russia 'a lot'

The 27 European Union members nations have unanimously agreed on an initial set of sanctions targeting Russian officials over their actions in Ukraine , according to French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said the package approved Tuesday “will hurt Russia , and it will hurt a lot.”

He says the package will also affect Russia's financing of policies linked to Ukraine by limiting access to EU financial markets.

“This story is not finished,” said Borrell of Russian actions in Ukraine.

WATCH: Putin humiliates spy chief on world stage: 'Speak, speak, speak plainly!'

Russian President Vladimir Putin mocked one of his chief officials during a televised meeting Monday, telling the intelligence officer to "speak plainly."

The Russian president grew testy with Director of Foreign Intelligence Sergey Naryshkin during a tense meeting on Ukraine . Putin was seemingly annoyed at what he characterized as unclear statements of support for declaring the independence of two Ukrainian regions.

"With the suggestion of Nikolai Platonovich, that we could give our, how to say it, Western partners, one last chance. Presenting them with the choice, in the shortest time frame, to force Kyiv to choose peace and implement the Minsk agreements," Naryshin told the president. "In the worst case, we must make the decision that we are discussing today."

"What does it mean, 'in the worst case'? Are you suggesting we start negotiations?" Putin asked. "Or to recognize sovereignty?" 

As Naryshkin stuttered, attempting to respond, Putin pressed him harder.

"Speak, speak, speak plainly!" Putin said.

Ukraine-Russia crisis could push inflation to 10% if conflict escalates

U.S.  inflation  is already at the highest level in four decades. The worsening  Ukraine -Russia crisis could push it even higher.

That's because the conflict is threatening to send oil prices above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, according to RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas. Oil prices already surged to a fresh eight-year high on Tuesday after Moscow ordered troops into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, with Brent crude, the global benchmark, hitting $97.63.

A war in Europe – which many foreign policy experts say is a real possibility – could cause oil prices to climb as much as 20% to $120 a barrel, Brusuelas estimated. Should that happen, consumer prices in the U.S. would surge above 10% on an annual basis, the economist said, the highest since October 1981. 

"The potential for a broader energy shock to the global and U.S. economies should Russia invade Ukraine has added to a combustible mix of factors that is causing inflation to accelerate in the United States and abroad," Brusuelas said. "That risk carries with it the potential to slow down growth."

UK: Sanctions target 'Putin's inner circle', supporters of Crimea occupation

The United Kingdom's Foreign Office said Tuesday that "oligarchs at the heart of Putin’s inner circle and banks which have bankrolled the Russian occupation of Crimea have been targeted by the first wave of U.K. sanctions in response to Russia’s further violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty."

"It sends a clear message that the U.K. will use our economic heft to inflict pain on Russia and degrade their strategic interests," Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said. "And we are prepared to go much further if Russia does not pull back from the brink. We will curtail the ability of the Russian state and Russian companies to raise funds in our markets, prohibit a range of high tech exports, and further isolate Russian banks from the global economy."

The Foreign Office also said it will "sanction those members of the Russian Duma and Federation Council who voted to recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk in flagrant violation of Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty."

How Russia's latest actions in Ukraine are impacting the markets

U.S. stocks remained lower Tuesday morning but were off the worst levels of the session as investors weigh earnings from retailers against Russian President Vladimir Putin's ordering of troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine.

Dow futures were down over 100 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite saw dips of 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively. 

Western powers fear that Russia might use skirmishes in Ukraine's eastern regions as a pretext for an attack on the democracy, which has defied Moscow’s attempts to pull it back into its orbit.

West Texas Intermediate crude spiked to over $93 per barrel, while Brent, the global benchmark hit $97, as Germany announced plans to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia because of Moscow's actions in Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced. Natural Gas prices jumped over 3%.

"I've received a request from the foreign ministry. I will consider the issue of severing diplomatic relations between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. Immediately after our press conference, I will consider this issue," Reuters quoted Zelenskyy as saying.

European Union, UK to sanction Russia over moves in Ukraine

European Union foreign ministers have planned a meeting Tuesday to decide what sanctions to impose over Russia’s decision to recognize two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine .

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the aim is not to impose the whole range of sanctions that the EU has prepared should Russian invade Ukraine, but rather to address the recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent.

Separately, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Putin had “completely torn up international law” and incoming British sanctions will target not just the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk but “Russian economic interests as hard as we can.”

Johnson is to set out further details of his country's sanctions in the House of Commons later Tuesday.

Russia on Tuesday said its recognition of independence for two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine includes territory currently held by Ukrainian forces as well.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia has recognized the rebel regions’ independence “in borders that existed when they proclaimed” their independence in 2014. 

Ukrainian forces later reclaimed control of large part of both regions during a nearly eight-year conflict that has killed over 14,000 people.

Late Monday, convoys of armored vehicles were seen rolling across the separatist-controlled territories. It wasn’t immediately clear if they were Russian.

Russian officials haven't yet acknowledged any troop deployments to the rebel east, but Vladislav Brig, a member of the separatist local council in Donetsk, told reporters that the Russian troops already had moved in, taking up positions in the region's north and west.

Germany on Tuesday is taking steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia because of Moscow's actions in Ukraine , Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced.

Scholz said that the government had decided to “reassess” the certification of the pipeline, which hasn’t begun operating yet, in light of the latest developments.

“That will certainly take time, if I may say so,” he said.

Germany meets about a quarter of its energy needs with natural gas, a share that will increase in the coming years as the country switches off its last three nuclear power plants and phases out the use of coal. About half of the natural gas used in Germany comes from Russia.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, during a speech to the United Nations Security Council Monday, criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for recognizing two eastern Ukraine breakaway regions.

"He has since announced that he will place Russian troops in these regions. He calls them peacekeepers. This is nonsense," she said. "We know what they really are. In doing so, he has put before the world a choice. We must meet the moment, and we must not look away."

"We do not have to guess at President Putin’s motives," she added. "Today, President Putin made a series of outrageous, false claims about Ukraine aimed at creating a pretext for war, and immediately thereafter, announced Russian troops are entering the Donbas."

Invasion imminent?

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Monday that he will recognize the independence of the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic regions in eastern Ukraine, an apparent signal that he will not back down from a potential invasion.

Russia expert Rebekah Irina Koffler said, "Having recognized the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics and signed treaties today, Russia will almost certainly deploy armed forces, imminently, to occupy these breakaway territories. Putin has already authorized the deployment of 'peacekeeping' troops into Eastern Ukraine."

Meanwhile, President Biden signed an executive order Monday imposing economic sanctions on these separatist Ukraine regions, but he stopped short of imposing penalties directly on Russia. A senior administration official tells Fox News that further measures will be taken Tuesday "to hold Russia accountable for this clear violation of international law."

Biden's agreement "in principle" to meet with Putin may be off after Russia's independence declaration. The senior administration official told Fox News that they "can't commit" to a meeting as Russia continues to prepare for military action.
