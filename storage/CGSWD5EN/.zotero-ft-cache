The United Nations' refugee agency says Russia's invasion of Ukraine has already prompted more than 2 million people to flee the war, sparking the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

Russia's and Ukraine's foreign ministers met for high-level negotiations in Antalya, Turkey, on Thursday. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, proposed new humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol and a 24-hour cease-fire to Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, but no agreement was reached .

The talks came after Ukrainian officials said that three people had died in a Russian airstrike that devastated a hospital complex in Mariupol. Russian officials acknowledged a strike had been carried out but insisted the facility was being used as a paramilitary base.

Two weeks into the war, meanwhile, Ukrainians continue to flow into neighboring countries, the majority of whom, more than 800,000, have crossed into Poland.
