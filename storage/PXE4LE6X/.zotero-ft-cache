Gal Gadot has been dethroned as the queen of cringe.

AnnaLynne McCord posted a bizarre video Thursday pleading for peace between Russia and Ukraine that the internet lambasted as tone-deaf and likened to Gadot’s infamous 2020 “Imagine” video .

“Dear President Vladimir Putin, I’m so sorry that I was not your mother,” the “90210” alum began a spoken-word poem she tweeted .

McCord, 34, addressed the video to the Russian president after he ordered his troops to invade neighboring Ukraine early Thursday.

“If I was a mother, you would have been so loved, held in the arms of joyous light,” she continued.

“Never would this story’s plight, the world unfurled before our eyes, a pure demise of nation sitting peaceful under the night sky. If I was your mother, the world would have been warm.”

McCord said she could not imagine the “soul-stealing pain” the authoritarian must have felt as a child to believe that he “lived in a cruel, unjust world.”

“If I was your mother, if the world was cold, I’d have died to make you warm. … I’d have died to give you life,” she continued in the clip before stating that she “cannot believe” she was born “too late” to be Putin’s mother.

“I know if I was your mother, that would be a start toward the awareness of what a powerful being of light you could be. I cannot believe I was born too late, in a different place.”

While some of the actress’ followers argued that she meant well, countless others were perplexed that she would post the video at the start of an already deadly war .

“THIS WILL DEFINITELY STOP HIM!! YOU ARE SO STRONG AND BRAVE ANNALYNNE MCCORD,” one Twitter user sarcastically wrote , while another joked, “Just sing ‘Imagine’ next time. It’s easier than whatever this is.”

Over on Instagram , one user joked, “Gal Gadot’s crown just slipped a little,” while others offered McCord some notes on her prose.

“you gon have to up your rhyme game if you tryna stop a war… this ain’t no lullaby booboo,” one netizen wrote.

World leaders have been condemning Putin over the unprovoked attack, with US President Biden saying the move came “without justification or necessity.” Biden also announced new sanctions and export restrictions against Moscow.
