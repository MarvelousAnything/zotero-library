United States President Joe Biden has said he is “convinced” that Russia’s Vladimir Putin has made a decision to invade Ukraine, warning Moscow against starting what he called a “war of choice” that would be catastrophic.

But the US president said the door for diplomacy remains open. Until war breaks out, “diplomacy is always a possibility”, Biden told reporters on Friday.

Meanwhile, Ukraine’s top security official Oleksiy Danilov accused Russia of staging provocations in conflict-hit eastern Ukraine to try to provoke Ukraine’s military to respond, but added that Kyiv would stick to peaceful ways to defuse the crisis.

Danilov said on Friday Ukraine had no plans to recapture separatist-held territories by force, adding that a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine was unlikely.

Earlier, Moscow-backed separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine announced they will evacuate civilians to Russia as fears of a significant escalation in fighting grow.

Biden says US and NATO are ‘united’

After holding calls with European leaders and US legislators attending the Munich Security Conference, Biden said the US is united internally and on the same page as its allies in rejecting a Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“Despite Russia’s efforts to divide us at home and abroad, I can affirm that has not happened,” Biden said on Friday. “The overwhelming message of both on both calls was one of unity, determination and resolve.”

    The American people are united. Europe is united. The Transatlantic community is united. The entire free world is united.

    Russia has a choice — between war and all the suffering that it will bring — or diplomacy that will make the future safer for everyone.

Biden says Russia has plans to attack Kyiv in ‘coming days’

Biden has accused Russia of planning to attack the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in the “coming days”.

“We have reason to believe the Russian forces are planning and intend to attack Ukraine in the coming week – in the coming days,” the US president said on Friday. “We believe that they will target Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people.”

Biden renewed calls for Moscow to de-escalate. “If Russia pursues this plan, it will be responsible for a catastrophic and needless war of choice,” he said.
Transatlantic leaders affirm support for Ukraine: White House

US President Joe Biden and his European counterparts affirmed support for Ukraine’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity” and renewed warnings for Russia against invading its neighbour during a phone call on Friday, the White House said.

“They pledged to continue pursuing diplomacy to de-escalate tensions while ensuring readiness to impose swift, coordinated economic costs on Russia should it choose further conflict,” the White House said in a statement describing the talks.

“The leaders also discussed efforts to ensure the defense and security of NATO’s eastern flank.”

The call included the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Romania as well as European Union and NATO officials.

    I spoke today with Transatlantic Allies and partners to discuss Russia’s military build-up in and around Ukraine. We agreed on our support for Ukraine, to continue diplomatic efforts, and affirmed our readiness to impose massive costs on Russia should it choose further conflict.

Former NATO chief says Putin has not ‘made up his mind’

Former NATO chief Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said it appears that Putin has not made a decision on whether to invade Ukraine.

“I think he has not made up his mind yet,” de Hoop Scheffer told Al Jazeera on Friday.

“But he is so high up in the tree that climbing down without loss of face is almost impossible. And that is the reason that I think it is highly probable now that some form of action will follow suit.”

De Hoop Scheffer said the Russian president might not have expected the “unprecedented solidarity” within NATO and the EU.

Sanctions meant as ‘deterrent’, White House says

White House Spokesperson Jen Psaki appeared to rule out preemptive sanctions against Russia over a possible invasion of Ukraine, saying that the economic measures are intended to dissuade Moscow from taking military action against its neighbour.

“Our collective view from our national security team is that sanctions are meant to be a deterrent,” Psaki told reporters. “If you put all the sanctions in place now, what is stopping them from invading?”

US congressman says situation is ‘dire’, warns of major consequences

US Congressman Seth Moulton has warned there would be various consequences if Russia decides to invade Ukraine.

“If that happens, the consequences for the West, the consequences for the future of NATO, the immediate refugee consequences and the massive loss of life, will be something we haven’t seen in a very long time,” he said, adding that the window for diplomacy “remains open”.

The United Kingdom’s foreign ministry has said the country’s embassy in Ukraine was moving away from the capital Kyiv and it told British nationals to leave the country while commercial means of travel were still available.

The embassy office in Kyiv was relocating temporarily and staff were operating from an embassy office in the city of Lviv, the ministry said.

“Any Russian military action in Ukraine would severely affect the British government’s ability to provide consular assistance in Ukraine,” the ministry said. “British nationals should not expect increased consular support or help with evacuating in these circumstances.”

Germany to put its troops in NATO’s quick reaction force on higher alert

Germany will put its troops in NATO’s quick reaction force on higher alert, enabling them to deploy more quickly to protect Eastern European allies in case of an escalation of tensions with Russia, the defence ministry in Berlin has said.

The decision, taken in close cooperation with NATO’s highest military commander and allies, is a reaction to Russia’s conduct and meant to reduce the time needed to prepare for deployment in case of an activation of the NATO Response Force (NRF), the ministry said in a statement.

“The increased readiness to deploy enables NATO, in case of a further escalation by Russia, to guarantee appropriate reassurance in particular to our eastern European allies in order to protect allied territory,” the statement said.

Eastern Ukraine evacuations are ‘cynical use’ of people by Moscow, US says

The US government has said the evacuation of civilians by Russia-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine was a “cynical” move by Moscow.

“Announcements like these are further attempts to obscure through lies and disinformation that Russia is the aggressor in this conflict,” a Department of State spokesperson told reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.

“It is also cynical and cruel to use human beings as pawns to distract the world from the fact that Russia is building up its forces in preparation for an attack.”

Russian false flag operation more likely than invasion in Ukraine, Germany says

The most likely scenario for a Russian attack on Ukraine is not a fully-fledged invasion but rather a false flag operation or a coup, German Foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has said.

“The scenario of a full invasion might be possible but I am not sure this is really the most likely scenario,” she told the Munich Security Conference, speaking in English.

“I would be more afraid that the most likely scenario is a false flag [operation] or a coup or also other things like … if all the electricity will fall down here at this hotel, we would all go nuts and totally crazy,” she added, apparently alluding to a cyber-attack or an attack on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure.

Estonia sends Javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine

Estonia delivered Javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, the Estonian Ministry of Defence has said.

“This is a small step by Estonia in support of Ukraine, but it is a real and tangible contribution to defence against Russian aggression.”

Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from the village of Novoselovka, in eastern Ukraine, says the separatists’ evacuation announcements are “a very worrying development”.

Speaking at a news conference in Moscow alongside his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, Putin also said Russia was ready to follow a negotiation track with NATO on its security demands.

“These are annual drills that are scheduled to take place, usually in October, but this year they have been moved forward as they have been in the past,” she said.

“So it’s not completely unusual, but of course, this is going to be seen [by Kyiv and the West] as yet another step that Russia is taking to further flex its military and nuclear capabilities … this is really the pinnacle of Putin’s show of strength at this time.”
