Description
A database consisting of 2,640 equations compiled from the literature for predicting the biomass of trees and tree components from diameter measurements of species found in North America. Bibliographic information, geographic locations, diameter limits, diameter and biomass units, equation forms, statistical errors, and coefficients are provided for each equation, along with examples of how to use the database. The CD-ROM included with the paper version of this publication contains the complete database (Table 3) in spreadsheet format (Microsoft Excel 2002© with Windows XP©). The database files can also be viewed in both spreadsheet and pdf formats by directing your browser to the Global Change page at http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/global/pubs/books/index.html
