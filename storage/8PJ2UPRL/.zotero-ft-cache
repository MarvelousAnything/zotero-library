U.S. President Joe Biden held what he called a “great” call with European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, as western nations work to strike a unified position on Russia. 

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization said it would boost its deployments in eastern Europe in a bid to deter a new Russian invasion in Ukraine as the Pentagon announced it’s put 8,500 troops on heightened alert. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied he’s planning an attack.
