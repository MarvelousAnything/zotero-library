Biden is ‘convinced’ Putin has decided to invade Ukraine, but says there’s still time for diplomacy

President Joe Biden said that he is “convinced” that Vladimir Putin has “made the decision” to invade Ukraine, an invasion that might come in the next days, based on US intelligence.

But it was not too late to reverse that decision, Biden warned: “Russia can still choose diplomacy. It is not too late to deescalate and return the negotiation table.”

Biden said the US and its European allies were united in their resolve to impose “severe” economic sanctions on Russia in response to an attack on Ukraine , and that Russia would also face the “moral outrage” of the rest of the world should it choose war.

“There are many issues that divide our nation and our world, but standing up to Russian aggression is not one of them. Americans are united...the entire free world is united,” he said.

“Make no mistake, if Russia pursues these plans, it will be responsible for a catastrophic and needless war of choice.”

“United States and our allies are prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory from any threat to our collective security,” Biden said. “We also will not send troops in to fight in Ukraine, but we will continue to support the Ukrainian people.”

He cited hundreds of millions of dollars in previous US military support to Ukraine.

Ukraine crisis: Biden ‘convinced’ Russia plans invasion; Putin oversees nuclear drills – live

Russia’s leader will oversee major military drills along Ukraine’s borders on Saturday, according to Agence France-Presse, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was due to travel to Germany to meet Western leaders.

Zelensky was expected to meet with US Vice President Kamala Harris, AFP reported. However, Biden, who has said he is “convinced” Putin has decided to invade Ukraine , has suggested that “in the pursuit of a diplomatic solution, it may be the wise choice” for Zelensky to stay.

The US says it believes an attack by Russia is inevitable. It points to an estimated 149,000 Russian troops are stationed on Ukraine’s borders - as many as 190,000, when including the Russian-backed separatist forces.

Russia’s defence ministry announced that Putin would personally oversee previously scheduled drills involving nuclear-capable missiles on Saturday.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, who attended the Munich Security Conference, has warned the size of the assembled Russian force far exceeded that needed for military drills, and that Russia had the capacity to invade without warning.

Australia would not send troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion, but would provide other forms of practical assistance, prime minister Scott Morrison said.

Morrison told reporters in Darwin on Saturday that an invasion is “regrettably inevitable”, according to a report by Australian Associated Press.

It quotes the following comments by Morrison:

    Australia has not been asked or nor would we be providing support through troops or anything of that nature.

    We work with our allies and partners in many other ways, and we will seek to do that with the practical things that we can do to assist those efforts.

    We have had such discussions with the UK prime minister and others about how we proceed along that basis...

    They cannot use the threat of war and invasion as a way of trying to leverage and negotiate other changes that they may be seeking.

    This is not how free nations, democratic nations, nations in favour of peace, should behave. We have seen this before and we cannot allow it to stand.

The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine says it has observed “a dramatic increase” in attacks along the front line in eastern Ukraine .

In a statement , it said:

    In recent days, the OSCE Special Monitoring to Ukraine (SMM) has observed a dramatic increase in kinetic activity along the contact line in eastern Ukraine, equal to the numbers of ceasefire violations reported before the July 2020 agreement on the Measures to strengthen the ceasefire took effect.

The OSCE’s Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine has been deployed in eastern Ukraine since war broke out in 2014.

It added:

    The SMM is currently following up on the allegations made by the sides, and its access to these areas must be ensured without hindrance. All corroborated and established facts continue to be made public in the SMM’s reports.

    At this time of high tension, the SMM reiterates its call to the sides to strictly adhere to all of the commitments they have made, and take all necessary steps to reduce tensions and work towards immediate de-escalation for the benefit of the lives of innocent civilians on both sides of the contact line who continue to suffer from this conflict.

The OSCE reported there had been 222 ceasefire violations for the Donetsk region on Thursday, including 135 explosions, up from 189 the previous day and 24 on Tuesday.

For the Lugansk region , it reported 648 violations, including 519 explosions, up from 402 the previous day and 129 on Tuesday.

Reuters is reporting that Russia and China have watered down a G20 finance leaders’ statement on geopolitical risks to the global economy - removing a reference to “current” tensions.

Warnings of a possible war in Ukraine have prompted nervousness in the financial markets.

Here is more from Reuters’ report:

    The gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 major economies was one of the most fractious since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, according to people familiar with the discussions.

    Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland strayed from the G20 economic script to issue an impassioned plea to her Russian counterparts to not invade Ukraine, warning that such action would hurt the global economy and bring “crushing” sanctions against Russia , according to two sources familiar with her remarks.

    Other sources familiar with the meeting said China and Russia had objected to the reference to “current tensions” in an earlier draft communique, as well as disagreements on debt restructuring for poor countries and carbon pricing.

    The group’s final communique simply said: “We will also continue to monitor major global risks, including from geopolitical tensions that are arising, and macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities.”

    As the meeting concluded, US and European stocks fell on worries that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent after Russian-backed separatists announced a surprise evacuation of their breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.

Hello, Rebecca Ratcliffe here in Bangkok, taking over from Lois Beckett.

Here’s the latest from President Biden on Twitter:

    President Biden (@POTUS)

    The United States and our Allies and partners will support the Ukrainian people.

    We will hold Russia accountable for its actions.

    The West is united and resolved — and we are ready to impose severe sanctions on Russia if it further invades Ukraine .
    February 19, 2022 

Earlier this evening , Biden said he was convinced that Putin had decided to invade Ukraine and target its capital, Kyiv - but that, until the attack began, “diplomacy is always a possibility”.

Watching TV. Waiting for a bus. The vulnerable facing violence on the front lines.

There’s been a lot of diplomatic rhetoric today about the possibility of a “catastrophic” war in Ukraine. Reporters at the front lines in eastern Ukraine , including my colleague Shaun Walker, have already been documenting the toll of violence on “the mainly elderly and vulnerable people” there.

    Shaun Walker (@shaunwalker7)

    Firing from Rus-backed forces has escalated in last few days near Donbass front line leading to more heartbreak for the mainly elderly & vulnerable people here.

“I just hope there isn’t going to be any more of this. I can’t sleep at night. My arms and legs are shaking, and it’s scary,” a 77-year-old man whose roof was damaged in the attacks told Walker.

Reporters for BuzzFeed reported similar anguish among the elderly, as well as the very young.

    MARIINKA, Ukraine – Valentina Gordeyeva was waiting for a bus when a rocket came crashing down beside her, spraying fire-hot shrapnel that struck her in the left hand and lower abdomen.

Other residents were finding different ways of coping. At a youth centre in Mariinka, Buzzfeed reported: “12-year-old twins Veronika and Yeva were hard at work on art projects in a room where rocket shrapnel had shattered a window the day before....They weren’t scared, they said, because the shelling hadn’t happened ‘in a while’ and they weren’t convinced that it would continue or grow worse.”

    In Mariinka, some residents said they were frightened by the prospect of a return to full-scale war. But others said they had become numb to the fighting and don’t believe a peaceful solution can be found. https://t.co/E858146qCt pic.twitter.com/e52HNeong5

Summary: a day of fast-moving events that brought Ukraine closer to the brink of war

There’s been a lot of Ukraine news in the past day. Our live coverage will continue, but here’s a recap of some key events of the past few hours:

    Joe Biden said in a speech late Friday that he is ‘convinced’ Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine, but says there’s still time for diplomacy to avert war. The invasion could come in the next days or week, the US president said. Biden said that the US and its European allies were ready to impose “severe” economic sanctions on Russia in response to an attack, but that it would not send troops to fight in Ukraine.
    As Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy was reportedly still mulling whether or not he would leave the country for a conference in Germany on Saturday, Biden said that “in the pursuit of a diplomatic solution, it may be the wise choice” for him to stay.
    Leaders of Russian-backed breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk claimed to be under attack from Ukraine and ordered the mass evacuation of civilians.
    As the US and its allies warned of “false flags” that would give a pretext for a Russian attack, a gas pipeline in Luhansk caught fire after explosions , and a second blast hit the city about 40 minutes later. Earlier on Friday, a car bomb detonated in an empty lot in Donetsk.
    Biden called out Russian “disinformation” and said that claims in the Russian media that Ukraine was the aggressor and planning a major attack “ defies basic logic” of what a country would do over 150,000 troops arrayed at its borders.
    Reporters at the front lines in eastern Ukraine are already documenting the toll of escalating violence on civilians, many of them elderly and especially vulnerable.

Reporting from Washington and Munich, my colleagues Julian Borger and Patrick Wintour have a definitive summary of the day’s developments, from Biden’s warnings, to reports of gas pipeline explosions in eastern Ukraine, to satellite imagery of troop movements. It’s worth a read in full.

White House on US call with allies: ‘Swift, coordinated economic costs on Russia’

There’s not much new in the White House summary of Joe Biden’s call with transatlantic leaders earlier today, and echoes the president’s own remarks this evening: “deep concern” over Russia’s build-up of forces, “strong support” for Ukraine’s sovereignty, a commitment to continued diplomacy, and a promise of “readiness to impose swift, coordinated economic costs on Russia should it choose further conflict”.

Biden said explicitly in his press conference earlier today that he would not send troops to fight in Ukraine .

Privately, administration officials have urged Zelenskiy to stay in Ukraine given their concerns about an imminent invasion, CNN reported.

Another sign of the political atmosphere: Russia’s parliamentary speaker, Vyacheslav Volodin, said on his Telegram channel today that “Russia does not want war,” but that it will “stand up” for compatriots in Donetsk and Lugansk if their lives are threatened, TASS, a major Russian news agency, reported .

First reactions: Biden’s speech on Russia’s potential ‘catastrophic and needless war of choice’

Some early reactions after Biden’s press conference this evening: Is Biden hoping that Putin will want to prove him wrong on the imminence of an invasion?

    Ilya Lozovsky (@ichbinilya)

    It seems like the last chance left is that Putin will be tempted to own Biden by not invading and proving him wrong. Maybe that’s a last chance Biden is knowingly giving him?
    February 18, 2022 

Like Biden, French officials are saying the path for diplomacy is still open.

    Biden says he’s convinced Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine .

Biden: Russian claims that Ukraine is planning a Donbas attack ‘defies basic logic’

Joe Biden said that the reports in Russian media “claiming Ukraine is planning to launch a massive offensive attack in the Donbas” were “disinformation.”

“It defies basic logic to believe that the Ukrainians would choose this moment, with well over 150,000 troops arrayed on its borders, to escalate a yearlong conflict,” the US president said.

Biden highlighted Russian media’s “phony allegations of a genocide taking place in the Donbas,” as well as the shelling of a Ukrainian kindergarten yesterday , which he said Russia had “falsely asserted was carried out by Ukraine.”

These were all part of the Russian “playbook to set up a false justification to attack Ukraine,” Biden said, which the US and allies have been warning about for weeks.

Biden praised the “restraint” and “judgement” of Ukrainian troops, who “have refused to allow Russia to bait them into war.”

Biden said the US was “calling out Russia’s plans loudly and repeatedly, not because we want a conflict, but because we are doing everything in our power to remove any reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine.”

Reports of explosion causing a pipeline fire in eastern Ukraine

A part of a gas pipeline near Luhansk, one of the main cities in Ukraine’s breakaway region of People’s Republic of Luhansk, caught fire late on Friday after a blast, Russian news agencies reported, citing correspondents on the ground.

The pipeline was struck by “a powerful explosion,” Interfax news agency reported, citing a local natural gas supplier.

The new report of a pipeline fire comes as the US and others have been warning of “false flag” incidents that could be used by Russia as a pretext for an attack on Ukraine.

Pro-Russian Telegram channels are claiming the fire is the result of Ukrainians blowing up a gas pipeline near Luhansk.

In other news, the foreign ministers for Germany and France released a joint statement today warning about Russia constructing pretext to justify a military escalation.

German minister Annalena Baerbock and French minister Jean-Yves Le Drian released the statement shortly after 3:00 pm eastern time, with the two ministers stating towards the latter half of the statement:

    We have noted the announcement of the leaders of the self-proclaimed “People’s Republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk to evacuate the region’s residents to Russia as a so-called precautionary measure in anticipation of a possible Ukrainian attack. We do not see any grounds for these allegations and urge Russia to use its influence over the self-proclaimed republics to encourage restraint and contribute to de-escalation.

    We are concerned that staged incidents could be misused as pretext for possible military escalation.
