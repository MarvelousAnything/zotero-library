“They haven’t – from our best estimates – have not made any appreciable progress geographically speaking, in the last 24 to 36 hours,” Kirby told reporters.

He said the Pentagon believes the advance has slowed down because Russian forces are deliberately regrouping while also facing unanticipated logistic challenges and experiencing resistance from Ukrainians.

On the road in eastern Ukraine, everywhere is the front line

After Russia crossed the border on February 24, it was not so much a matter of if the port city in eastern Ukraine would be targeted in the advance, but when.

Mariupol’s eastern suburbs, 10km (six miles) from the front line with Russian-backed separatists, have already suffered years of violence, but during the last week, Russian troops have moved in from every direction and the area has been pounded incessantly with rockets and other projectiles.

Reports of ‘heavy casualties’ in Mariupol: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Zaporizhzhia, a city in southeastern Ukraine, says there are reports of “heavy casualties” in Mariupol, a key port city in the country’s south.

“The mayor … is alleging that Russian forces are blocking the exit of civilians from the city,” Stratford said.

“We know that there was a large tank column and a lot of Russian weapons moved into positions to the west of the city over the last couple of days,” he added.

“We also know that there has been a lot of shelling on the east of the city as well, since this war started.”

Stratford said the Russians appeared to be “desperately trying to create a land corridor” linking the northern part of the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, with the self-proclaimed, Russian-backed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.

“And it certainly looks as if there has been so far today what can only be described as an escalation as Russia tries to push further forwards in multiple locations around the country,” he added.

UAE reimposes visa requirements on Ukrainians

The Ukrainian embassy in the United Arab Emirates says the Gulf country is reimposing visa requirements on Ukrainians.

Lavrov says Russia will not let Ukraine obtain nuclear weapons: Report

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said Moscow will not allow Ukraine to obtain nuclear weapons, according to a report by the country’s TASS news agency.

Lavrov’s reported remarks came a day after he alleged at a Geneva disarmament meeting that Kyiv has been seeking to acquire nuclear weapons.

“Ukraine still has Soviet technologies and the means of delivery of such weapons,” he told the Conference on Disarmament in a pre-recorded address. “We cannot fail to respond to this real danger.”

Lavrov delivered his speech to a thin crowd after diplomats from many countries staged a walk-out to protest against Russia’s invasion. Moscow has moved to put its own nuclear forces on high alert in recent days.

Russia aims to ‘erase us’, Ukraine’s Zelenskyy says

Zelenskyy has claimed that nearly 6,000 Russians have been killed during Moscow’s invasion and warned the Kremlin it will not be able to take control of Ukraine with bombs and air raids.

In a video address, the Ukrainian president said a Russian missile strike in the capital on Tuesday which hit a Holocaust memorial complex “proves that for many people in Russia our Kyiv is absolutely foreign”.

“They don’t know a thing about Kyiv, about our history. But they all have orders to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all,” he added.

Russia has not publically declared how many of its troops have been killed and Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the figures provided by Zelenskky.

People leaving Russia limited to carrying $10,000 as sanctions bite

Russian residents are no longer allowed to leave the country with more than the equivalent of $10,000 as the Kremlin tries to keep capital inside the country.

The rule affects the movement of foreign currency, too, and seems designed to make sure that people attempting to leave Russia – as sanctions are slapped on the country – don’t take all of their hard currency with them.

Long queues are now common at cash machines that still have bank notes as people try to withdraw their holdings, against the backdrop of a rouble that is rapidly losing most of its value in light of the sanctions. Prices of imported goods are shooting up and people are trying to purchase some items, like new phones, before they become unaffordable.
