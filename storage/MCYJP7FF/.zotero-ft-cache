    Addressing the United Nations Security Council on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an urgent appeal against a Russian invasion.
    Some selling pressure has been alleviated as investors hope that a meeting between Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov next week will yield a diplomatic solution.

LONDON — European markets retreated once again on Friday, with global sentiment hanging in the balance as the Ukraine-Russia crisis reaches  a pivotal moment .

Addressing the United Nations Security Council on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an urgent appeal against a Russian invasion, after Western leaders rubbished the Kremlin's claims of a drawback of troops and Ukraine accused pro-Russian separatists of shelling a civilian village.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu on Friday, the Pentagon said, calling for de-escalation and the return of Russian forces to bases.

Ukraine's military denied the accusation and alleged that Russia was engaged in an information war.

Asia-Pacific shares mostly slid overnight as tensions in eastern Europe continued to rattle investors, but selling pressure eased on hopes that a meeting between Blinken and Lavrov next week may yield a diplomatic solution to the standoff.
