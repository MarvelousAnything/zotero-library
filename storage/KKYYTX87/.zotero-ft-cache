Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he is “ready to work further” with the West on security issues to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine, but emphasised the need for the West to heed Russia’s main demands.

He spoke on Tuesday during a news conference following talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Moscow.

Scholz said at the briefing that he agrees with Russia’s assessment that there is still a chance to avert war over Ukraine and that “diplomatic options are far from exhausted”.

Meanwhile, some troops in Russia’s military districts adjacent to Ukraine returned to their bases after completing drills, Russia’s defence ministry was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying, a move that could de-escalate friction between Moscow and the West.

But later on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden cast doubt on Moscow’s claims of a partial withdrawal, saying that Russian troops near Ukraine remain in a “threatening position”.

There is hope for de-escalation, says ex-US envoy to Ukraine

William B. Taylor, former US ambassador to Ukraine, said there is “hope” that de-escalating the crisis in Eastern Europe is still possible, stressing that a Russian military drawback from the Ukrainian border would be a “good indicator” for diplomacy.

“When we actually see units and tanks and artillery and missiles that are moving away from Ukraine’s border – rather than toward it as they have been for the past two months – when we see these military forces going back to their barracks, back to their home stations, that will be a very good indicator that there can be serious negotiations,” Taylor told Al Jazeera.

Biden and Macron affirm support for ‘diplomatic path forward’

Biden attempting to ‘grease the wheels’ of diplomacy: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera correspondent Mike Hanna said Biden went “out of his way” during his remarks on Tuesday to stress that diplomacy is still Washington’s preferred option to resolve the Ukraine crisis with Russia.

Hanna underscored Biden’s assertion to Russians that NATO and Ukraine do not pose a threat to their country.

“There had been increasing fears about the level of rhetoric being exposed by both sides,” Hanna said. “However, this [is] an attempt perhaps to begin to damp down that rhetoric, to begin to attempt to grease the wheels of diplomacy.”

US would respond ‘forcefully’ if Russia targets Americans: Biden

US President Joe Biden has stressed that the United States is not seeking a confrontation with Russia, but he warned Moscow against targeting US citizens in Ukraine.

“If Russia targets Americans in Ukraine, we will respond forcefully,” he said. “If Russia attacks the United States or our allies through asymmetric means, like disruptive cyber attacks against our companies or critical infrastructure, we’re prepared to respond.”

Biden added that while he will not send US troops to defend Ukraine, his administration will impose “powerful sanctions” on Russia if it invades its neighbour.

The US president also reiterated US commitment to the security and defence of NATO allies in Europe, calling it “sacrosanct”.

Invading Ukraine would be ‘self-inflicted wound’ for Russia: Biden

Biden has warned Russia that an invasion of Ukraine would be a “self-inflicted wound”.

“If Russia does invade in the days or weeks ahead, the human cost for Ukraine will be immense. And the strategic cost for Russia will also be immense,” Biden said.

“The world will not forget that Russia chose needless death and destruction; invading Ukraine will prove to be a self-inflicted wound,” he added.

    From the beginning of this crisis, I have been clear and consistent: The United States is prepared no matter what happens.

    We are ready for diplomacy to improve stability and security in Europe as a whole.

    And we are ready to respond decisively if Russia attacks Ukraine.

    — President Biden (@POTUS) February 15, 2022

Russian troops remain in ‘threatening position’, Biden says

Biden has cast doubt over Russia’s claim that it has partially withdrawn troops from near the Ukrainian border.

The US president added that a Russian invasion of its neighbour remains “distinctly possible”.

Ukrainians starting to think of preparing ‘for the worst’

Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from Kyiv, says that there has been “a very unusual atmosphere” with the mood shifting between pessimism and optimism.

“Up until now, most people have been pretty sanguine about the situation,” Butler said, adding that there has been “a bit of a change in the past few days”.

“Zelenskyy was calming for calm a couple of days ago, to then saying the Ukrainians must be ready to fight, calling for what he’s calling ‘A day of unity’, on Wednesday, February 16, a day that some intelligence officials in the West have said could be a day for an invasion,” Butler said.

“So people are starting to now think, ‘maybe I need to now prepare for the worst’.”

Russia recognition of separatist regions would be ‘attack without weapons’: France

Any recognition by Russia of two eastern Ukrainian separatist regions would represent the equivalent of an attack on the country’s sovereignty only without weapons, France has said.

“It would be an impossible situation, representing an attack without weapons and dismantling of the unity and integrity of Ukraine,” Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said after the Russian parliament asked Putin to recognise the Donetsk and Lugansk regions.

“It would be an attack on the sovereignty of Ukraine,” he told the French parliament.

Correspondent: Scepticism over Russia’s announcement

Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from Kyiv, said when Russia announced it was pulling out some troops back from the border, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he saw this as proof that diplomacy was working and a sign of de-escalation.

“Later though, it became apparent during the day that there was no actual proof of this pullback, and we’ve heard various Western officials and leaders say they are still waiting for proof,” Butler said.

“Kuleba has now said ‘we will believe it when we see it’. The Russian Federation, he said, is often saying that it does things, but then it does exactly the opposite. There is a lot of scepticism here about that.”

‘NATO on our doorstep’, Putin says

Putin has said at a news conference that a negotiation process should be held over the question of Ukraine’s NATO membership.

“They say that in the coming years, Ukraine will not be in NATO. What does that mean? … For 30 years, we have been told that there won’t be any kind of NATO expansion, not one inch eastwards. And today, we see the infrastructure of NATO on our doorstep,” Putin said.

“The whole question of Ukraine joining NATO is raised and they say it won’t be tomorrow. What about the day after tomorrow? What does that actually change for us historically speaking? Absolutely nothing.

“We hear that Ukraine is not ready to join NATO; we know that. At the same time, they say it’s not going to join tomorrow. But by the time they get ready for it, it may be too late for us. So we have to decide this question now, right now, in the very near future; we have to have a negotiation process for this,” Putin said.

“The government in Moscow should withdraw its troops and provide full transparency about its actions,” she stressed, adding that this is Russia’s obligation as a member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

Baerbock expressed concern over the recent escalation, and reiterated that Germany will continue its diplomatic efforts, together with its EU partners and NATO allies, for a peaceful solution to the crisis.

UK’s Truss says Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent

A Russian invasion of Ukraine is highly likely, could be imminent and would pose a threat to Europe’s wider stability that emboldens aggressors around the world, Britain’s Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Tuesday.

Truss said an invasion could be imminent, and Russian troops could reach Kyiv “very, very quickly”.

“This is … about the wider stability of Europe,” she told Sky News. “And it’s about wider global stability, and the message that we give to aggressors and we have to give the message to Vladimir Putin that there can be no reward for aggression.”

Truss echoed politicians in the US who have warned that a so-called “false flag” operation could be used by Moscow to trigger a conflict.

“It is still the case that an invasion could be imminent, and it is highly likely,” she said.

Russians scoff at Western fears of Ukraine invasion

While the US warns that Russia could invade Ukraine any day, the drumbeat of war is all but unheard in Moscow, where pundits and ordinary people alike do not expect President Putin to launch an attack on Russia’s ex-Soviet neighbour.

The Kremlin has cast the US warnings of an imminent attack as “hysteria” and “absurdity,” and many Russians believe that Washington is deliberately stoking panic and fomenting tensions to trigger a conflict for domestic reasons.

Speaking to reporters after President Biden’s call with Putin on Saturday, Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov bemoaned what he described as US “hysteria” about an allegedly imminent invasion, saying that the situation has “reached the point of absurdity”.

Russian officials have angrily denied any plans to attack Ukraine and dismissed Western concerns about the build-up near the country, arguing that Moscow is free to deploy its troops wherever it likes on its national territory.

Russia to respond if citizens are killed in eastern Ukraine

Russia will “respond” if Russian citizens start being killed anywhere, including in Ukraine’s rebel Donbas region, Russia’s RIA news agency cited Russian envoy to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, as saying.

“We will not invade Ukraine unless we are provoked to do that,” Chizhov said. “If the Ukrainians launch an attack against Russia, you shouldn’t be surprised if we counterattack. Or, if they start blatantly killing Russian citizens anywhere – Donbas or wherever.”

Aviation fears grow over Russia fallout from Ukraine crisis

Airlines and the leasing companies that control billions of dollars worth of passenger jets are drawing up contingency plans for a freeze in business with Russia if the standoff on Ukraine’s border boils over into a military conflict.

Aviation bosses are worried about the effect of dealings with Russian companies. Sanctions could disrupt payments to leasing firms, and any retaliatory move by Moscow to restrict access to Russian airspace might throw East-West trade into chaos.

“We are expecting an asymmetrical Russian response,” said a Western source involved in drawing up scenarios, adding the West was unlikely to restrict its own airspace first.

Scholz flies to Moscow in bid to avert war

German Chancellor Scholz heads to Moscow to meet President Putin in a high-stakes mission to avert war, with Russia’s largest trading partner in Europe warning of far-reaching sanctions if it attacks Ukraine.

The chancellor has said he will hammer home the message from the West that they are open to dialogue about Russia’s security concerns but will impose sanctions if it invades Ukraine.

“We are ready for very far-reaching and effective sanctions in coordination with our allies,” he said in Kyiv on Monday before returning to Berlin.

Warnings of sanctions could hit home harder coming from Germany, Russia’s number one trade partner in Europe and the biggest consumer of Russian natural gas – although that could also limit Scholz’s room for manoeuvre.
