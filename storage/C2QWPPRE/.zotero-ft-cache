Ukraine Live Updates: Russian Forces Push Ahead After Talks Failed to Make Progress

Russian forces surrounded Chernihiv, north of the capital, and continued their siege of the port city of Mariupol, where three people died on Wednesday when a bombardment hit a maternity hospital.

Here are the latest developments in Ukraine.

Russian forces were making slow, bitterly-fought advances in Ukraine on Thursday as high-level talks failed to yield progress on ending the war or even a temporary cease-fire. Russian troops were laying siege to Chernihiv , near the Belarus border, where the mayor reported that the city was running out of burial space as the death toll rises.

Although Russia has failed to capture major cities in the past week, its forces have gradually pushed forward into smaller population centers. Outside of Kyiv, Russian forces gained control of the town of Bucha and moved southwest in an attempt to encircle the capital. They were also approaching Kyiv from the east, with heavy fighting involving a line of Russian tanks reported in the suburb of Brovary, according to videos posted on Thursday.

There had been some hope that a meeting in Turkey between Ukraine and Russia’s foreign ministers might yield some progress on a cease-fire or safe passage to civilians trying to escape more besieged cites. But by the end of the day the two sides were still far apart . Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, indicated a cease-fire was not even on the table — and went so far as to deny Russia had attacked Ukraine at all.

Here are other major developments:

    Russian forces continued their siege of the embattled port city of Mariupol on Thursday , the day after a maternity hospital bombing that a Ukrainian official said killed three people, including a 6-year-old child.

    Vice President Kamala Harris visited Poland, a NATO ally worried about Russian aggression, pledging to “defend every inch of NATO territory.” She sidestepped questions about Poland’s offer to hand fighter jets over to the United States to transfer to Ukraine, a proposal the Pentagon has rejected.

    The British government on Thursday imposed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs, including Roman Abramovich , the owner of the Chelsea soccer club, and Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire aluminum magnate with ties to Mr. Putin.

    The leaders of the European Union member states were arriving at Versailles on Thursday to discuss Ukraine’s appeal to join the bloc.

    More companies pulled out of Russia, including the hotel chains Hyatt and Hilton. Hitachi said it was suspending exports to Russia and pausing manufacturing. The New York Times is tracking the pullouts . Goldman Sachs became the first big American bank to exit the country.

    Russia, China and the United States continue to trade accusations of spreading disinformation about the war in Ukraine. A day after the White House and State Department sharply criticized Russia and China for spreading “outright lies” about the United States secretly developing biological weapons in Ukraine, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday doubled down on the accusation.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said that Russia was committing war crimes against the Ukrainian people. “There are attacks on civilians that cannot be justified in any way whatsoever,” Thomas-Greenfield told the BBC. She is one of the highest ranking U.S. officials to accuse Russia of war crimes.

Evacuating Ukrainians with disabilities presents a range of difficulties.

Aid organizations in the United States and Europe say one group of Ukrainians has been particularly difficult to evacuate in the mass exodus since Russia invaded: people with disabilities.

At least 2.7 million Ukrainians are considered disabled, according to the country’s State Statistics Service, and relief organizations say they believe that many remain trapped in the country.

“It’s a dire situation,” said Anna Landre, the Ukraine crisis coordinator for the Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies, a U.S. disability-led disaster relief organization.

Among the situations that she said she was aware of is an orphanage in eastern Ukraine where about 100 children with disabilities are trapped, where food, medication and diapers are running out. Some of the children use wheelchairs, she said, and many cannot easily get out of bed. Ms. Landre said she did not want to name the orphanage or the town out of concern that doing so would further jeopardize their safety.

At a news conference on Thursday organized by European disability organizations, activists called on national governments and humanitarian aid groups to take further action to help those with disabilities in Ukraine by providing food, water, medicine and funding to organizations on the ground, as well as volunteers to help evacuate more people.

“We have seen two weeks of horror,” said Yulia Klepet, who has not been able to leave her apartment in Kyiv because she is caring for an adult daughter with autism and an 82-year old mother who cannot move.

“We cannot go downstairs to the bomb shelter,” she said, speaking through an interpreter at the news conference. “Even that, we cannot do.”

Many Ukrainians with disabilities are unable to walk or get to a train station, leaders of disability organizations said, or they need trains, buses and cars that are accessible. Others need to be transported on stretchers, or in a vehicle with electricity to power breathing machines.

Ms. Landre, the crisis coordinator, said that resources and accessible vehicles were hard to find.

“We could be doing this so much better if humanitarian organizations, who do this for a living, were actually inclusive of disabled people,” she said, adding, “it’s really frustrating, because we’re not equipped to do this work.”

WARSAW — Vice President Kamala Harris called Thursday for an investigation into whether Russia had committed war crimes against “innocent civilians” in Ukraine during a visit to Poland, which has taken in more than a million refugees from the two-week-old conflict.

Ms. Harris, speaking during a joint appearance in the capital with President Andrzej Duda of Poland, did not directly accuse Moscow of committing war crimes.

But she joined the chorus of world leaders and human rights groups calling for an international inquiry into the intensifying bombardment of heavily populated residential areas in recent days that include the sieges around Kyiv, Mariupol and other cities.

“When it comes to crimes and violations of international norms and rules, we are also very clear that any intentional attack on innocent civilians is a violation,” Ms. Harris said when asked if there should be an international investigation into possible war crimes.

“Absolutely there should be an investigation, and we should all be watching,” she added, referring to the ongoing investigation by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry.

The Biden administration has been independently gathering information on Russia’s attacks against civilians in Ukraine and sharing that with its allies, according to a senior administration official.

In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Ned Price, said on Thursday that the Russian president’s plan to quickly capture Ukraine had failed. “So he’s now turning to a strategy of laying waste to population centers, to try to break the will of the people of Ukraine — something he will not be able to do,” he said.

Ms. Harris arrived in Warsaw a day after Poland made a surprising offer to hand over Russian-made MIG fighters to the United States, so they could ultimately be transferred to Ukraine. The Biden administration quickly dismissed the idea, trying to avoid an action that might be viewed by Moscow as a military provocation by the United States or NATO.

Poland’s proposal added an unwelcome complication to an already high-stakes diplomatic trip meant to reassure NATO allies. Ms. Harris echoed the Pentagon’s position that the fighter jets offer was not tenable during her closed-door meeting with Polish leaders, according to a senior administration official.

But she took pains, in her public comments, to emphasize Washington’s commitment to defending its allies in the region through military aid and other support, telling reporters the United States was “prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory.”

And she was eager to put Poland’s announcement about the fighter jets behind both nations, and adamantly rejected the suggestion that there was any daylight between two countries seeking to close ranks against a common aggressor.

“I want to be very clear. The United States and Poland are united in what we have done and are prepared to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, full stop,” Ms. Harris said a joint news conference with Mr. Duda.

Ms. Harris is scheduled to travel to Romania on Friday.

Last week, Yuriy Blazhkevych, a taxi driver who lives in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, stood in his garage, scrolling through images of Ukraine on his phone that showed buildings with blasted-out windows, tanks rolling over cars and people fleeing for their lives.

Then there were the photos of dead children.

“I was crying,” he said from his home less than 24 hours before boarding a flight to Warsaw. “Every five minutes, there was something new. Then I told myself, ‘Either I watch the war on Facebook and write in comments and cry, or I go and help.’”

Mr. Blazhkevych, 63, is among a growing number of Ukrainians in New York and across the country, many of whom have never fired a weapon, who are heeding President Volodymyr Zelensky’s call to join the front line against Russia.

There is Ana Bogdanova, 37, a data scientist who is trading in the coffee shops and boutiques of Manhattan’s East Village for weapons training in her hometown, Ternopil. There is Ivan Danyliuk, 18, from Ridgewood, Queens, who is a waiter at Veselka, the popular Ukrainian restaurant in the East Village, which has become a hub for New Yorkers to show solidarity. And there is Yuriy Nikolaevich, 55, a forest engineer who has lived in Somerset, N.J., for 20 years.

They are hoping to join other Ukrainians and non-Ukrainians from across the world, including from Canada, France, Britain, and Sweden, among other places, who have either traveled to Ukraine to help in the battlefield or traveled to bordering countries like Poland to help with a spiraling refugee crisis. Some have military training. Others do not. Many have been determined to show international solidarity with Ukraine amid a heightening Russian incursion.

Among those who have already left from New York are Bogdan Globa, 33, a gay rights activist who lives on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and is helping with humanitarian aid along the Polish border, and Andrey Liscovich, 37, a Harvard-educated tech entrepreneur who left his Silicon Valley job to fight in Zaporizhzhia, the site of Europe’s largest nuclear plant, which was recently taken over by Russian forces .

“I’m super scared but it doesn’t change anything,” said Ms. Bogdanova, who requested to replace her surname with the equivalent of a middle name for this article, because her parents, who are in Ukraine, are not aware of her decision.

“Let me put it this way: When I see ants in my kitchen, I collect them, I put them outside,” Ms. Bogdanova said. “I can’t stand to hurt another being that’s alive. But in this case, they’re destroying, bombing every single day. I’ll do what I’m supposed to do. I will take up arms — I will not hesitate.”

‘You just have to open the door and help people’: Poland’s tourism industry pictches in.

Tourism in Poland’s historic city of Lublin was in a deep off-season lull last month when Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine , sending tens of thousands of people fleeing across the country’s eastern border, about 60 miles away.

Suddenly, rooms filled up at hotels as busloads of bleary-eyed refugees — mostly women and children — arrived in the town’s center looking for food and shelter.

The crisis has local travel workers and companies in Lublin swept up in an effort to supply transportation, accommodation and food to ensure that every refugee is provided with decent living conditions when they arrive. Bus companies are offering free rides, hotels have pledged to provide temporary free housing and workers are rounding up basic necessities for refugees who often had to leave everything behind.

Their efforts are part of a huge grassroots movement across Poland — and beyond — as individuals and businesses scramble to raise funds, collect donations and volunteer their time to aid Ukrainians who have fled Russia’s invasion of their country.

“We have a whole army here, a network of hotel connections that works as a crisis team 24 hours a day, communicating fast with each other to check the availability of rooms and sending Ukrainians to one another,” said Marta Koman, the director of the Arche Hotel Lublin . Arche Hotels, a Polish hotel chain, has pledged more than $1 million to provide free temporary housing for Ukrainian refugees across its 16 locations in Poland.

“Such help requires a lot of money, but these are special situations. I hope we will not have to escape also,” she said, referring to the prospect of the war spilling over to Poland.

Pitching in as translators and child-care workers

The scene at the Arche Hotel is emblematic of the situation at large in Lublin and in other towns and cities along the Polish border.

Employees there have been thrust into new roles, working around the clock as translators and child-care workers, handling logistics or simply providing emotional support for the arriving refugees. They say they are unable to think about the war’s impact on their livelihoods.

“I don’t think about tourism, you just have to open the door and help people,” said Anna Kurkowska, a server at the Arche Hotel Lublin. In addition to serving food to incoming Ukrainians, she is also helping to watch their children.

Among the refugees who have been staying at the hotel: a group of children from a Ukrainian orphanage. The Arche turned one of its conference rooms into a playroom where they screened fairy tales on the television and played games like hide and seek and tag.

Witalij Proszyn, a server of Ukrainian origin, has also been working as a translator. He said many of the people arriving were emotional and under great distress, with the staff scrambling to help.

“I do not know if it is still a hotel, it sure is, but it is also now a single-family house,” he said. “That’s how I feel.”

Not all hospitality companies have joined the effort, and some hotels have raised their prices during the crisis. At the Hilton Garden Inn in Rzeszów, not far over the Polish border from the Ukrainian city of Lviv, rooms that were going for about $80 suddenly cost more than $200, according to the hotel’s website; at the Victoria hotel in Lublin, rooms that usually cost between $40 and $60 now cost more than $140, according to its website. Governments have also block-booked hotel rooms and transport services for their staff, who often do not show up, which has caused accommodation shortages and contributed to price hikes.

Andrei Kuskovec, a 14-year-old from Ukraine’s Rivno region who is now being housed at the Arche, started breathing heavily as he described the moment he fled from his home with his mother and three siblings. They had to leave his father and one brother behind. (The Ukrainian government has mandated that men aged 18 to 60 are not allowed to leave the country.)

“Dad came over and said, ‘get dressed, in five minutes you’ll be leaving,’” Andrei recalled. “He could come with us, but he did not want to leave my brother behind who is 22 years old. If they decide to let men go, my brother will come, too, but for now, it is as it is.”

In the Arche Hotel lobby, a Ukrainian woman was shaking and crying. She had been on the phone with her parents in Ukraine when she heard an explosion over the line and the connection was lost. She had not been able to reach her husband and daughter for more than a day, and was unsure whether they were alive. When Ms. Koman, the hotel director, approached her, the woman showed her pictures on her phone and said, “this is my home, this is my home,” pointing to a Russian tank next to her house.

“We are professionals, but also we are people who have emotions, feelings, and seeing these people in pain and being fully professional is really very hard, but I think you have to adapt to the new situation,” Ms. Koman said.

‘War stopped everything’

One month ago, travel operators and local tourism boards had started voicing optimism about a post-pandemic recovery, receiving inquiries from international group tours and business travelers interested in visiting Poland after a two-year hiatus. Tourists spent more than $110 million in Lublin in 2019, according to the Central Statistical Office of Poland. Now, many fear that the war threatens any prospect of a rebound this spring and summer. They are bracing for an uncertain future, even as their present focus is on the plight of refugees.

“The outbreak of the war stopped everything,” said Krzysztof Raganowicz, the director of the Lublin Metropolitan Tourism Organization. “As a city and a region, we always lose when something disturbing happens beyond the eastern border of the country, even though it is completely safe in our city. Tourists prefer to choose places far from any dangers for a quiet vacation.”

As the war approaches a third week, some travel operators are exploring ways to assist refugees over the coming months. A local initiative run in collaboration with the tourism organization aims to start “guided city tours” to show newcomers core institutions of the area, including hospitals, schools and local government buildings. They also plan to organize cultural trips for children to local museums, galleries and other sights.

FlixBus, a German company that offers intercity bus service in Europe, has been offering free rides for refugees arriving at the Polish-Ukranian border. Free travel is also available for those arriving from Bucharest, the Romanian capital.

“Our priority is to help people coming from Ukraine and to help where it is the most urgent,” said Michał Leman, the managing director of FlixBus in Poland, Ukraine and the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

“Currently, most of our buses on routes from Przemyśl and Rzeszów are fully occupied, partly by passengers who bought tickets before the free travels were available, and partly by people who applied for such a ride,” he said. “We are closely monitoring the situation and will increase the number of connections for free travel if necessary.”

The Ilan Hotel in Lublin, in a building that once housed a yeshiva, was converted into a hotel by the Jewish Religious Community of Warsaw, which manages it. The hotel has blocked off all 40 of its rooms for refugees and is using its facilities to collect household items that will help them get settled.

“We are from a completely different industry, but at the moment we are fully focused on helping refugees,” said Agnieszka Kolibska, the hotel manager. “At the beginning, it was about immediate help for a few days, but now, we are also thinking about long-term help like finding jobs for people.”

“They really need everything from panties to socks and shoes, because the suitcases they had with them had to be left because there was no space in the train for their bags,” Ms. Kolibska said. “It’s not like they come with a suitcase and bags — they have two buns in black plastic bags and that is it.”
Sending help from farther afield

Larger travel companies have also joined the effort to offer facilities and services to refugees. Airbnb, in partnership with its nonprofit arm Airbnb.org, has been working with hosts to supply free temporary housing for up to 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine to neighboring countries like Poland, Hungary and Romania.

Thousands of people around the world have also booked and paid for Airbnbs within Ukraine, with no plans to travel there, in efforts to send money to Ukrainian homeowners. Between March 2 and 3, more than 61,000 nights were booked in Ukraine, 34,000 of them by people in the United States, the company reported.

Paige Holden, 43, an interior designer from Los Angeles, was at first skeptical about the initiative, concerned that if she booked an Airbnb property the hosts would not be able to access the funds. But after reaching out to some of them and seeing their desperation, she immediately booked an apartment in a Kyiv property, which sent $4,700 to a family of five.

“After I sent out an inquiry, a woman in Kyiv sent me a picture of her three young children, huddled in a cold, dark basement filled with other distraught families,” Ms. Holden said.

“You have to remember that these people lost everything overnight, their homes, their incomes, they have nothing left but to fight for their lives,” she said.

Over the past week, Benjamin Wagner, 27, a part-time tour guide and history student based in Berlin, has been driving refugees from that city’s central train station to host families across the city, volunteering through a WhatsApp group.

“At this time, it doesn’t matter where you are from, what you do or where you work,” Mr. Wagner said. “We all have one collective responsibility to help our Ukrainian brothers and sisters. This humanitarian crisis affects us all, and tomorrow we could be in their shoes.”

Following meetings in Turkey on Thursday with the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, described “a very dire situation” relating to Ukraine’s nuclear sites at Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia and said that “we need to move fast.” Grossi said “both sides agree” to the I.A.E.A.’s proposals for pursuing an agreed framework to reinforce the safety and security of the nuclear installations. But, he added, “There’s a lot to be discussed.”

Ukraine informed the United Nations on Thursday that the country was recalling all 308 military personnel it has deployed in a half-dozen U.N. peacekeeping missions around the world, along with equipment including eight helicopters, to join the Ukrainian defense against the Russian invasion. Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for the United Nations, said the organization was in the process of deciding how to replace the departing Ukrainian forces, which were part of peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Cyprus, Kosovo, Mali and the Abyei region between Sudan and South Sudan.

YANQING, China — The Ukrainian delegation at the Winter Paralympic Games in China held a demonstration for peace at the athletes’ village on Thursday.

The group unfurled a banner appealing for peace and observed a minute of silence in response to Russia’s invasion of their country.

The vigil was led by Valerii Sushkevych, the Ukraine Paralympic committee president. The delegation, including coaches, staff and all 20 athletes, raised fists under a banner that said, “Peace For All.”

The demonstration was an unusual departure for the Paralympics, which attempts to invoke neutrality and not weigh in specifically on international politics. But before the Games even opened, the International Paralympic Committee banned Russian and Belarusian athletes because of Russia’s invasion and the support of Belarus.

Andrew Parsons, the head of the I.P.C., broke protocol at the opening ceremony and denounced the invasion during his speech with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, in attendance. The I.P.C. posted a photograph of Thursday’s demonstration on its website and included comments by Sushkevych and others at the event.

“Stop war,” Sushkevych said. “If you are civilized, you must stop war.”

Andriy Nesterenko, the head coach of the delegation, described some of the destruction in Ukrainian cities, including Kharkiv, his hometown. “ There are seven people from our team from Kharkiv,” Nesterenko said, “but some of them doesn’t have the possibility to come back. Their flats, their private houses are already destroyed. We kindly ask the people all over the world, we need your support immediately. We need your support today, not later.”

Ukraine has a history of success at the Paralympics and has done well at the Beijing Games, too, collecting 19 medals through six days of competition. That placed it second behind China and its six gold medals are third behind China and Canada. In an interview earlier in the week, Sushkevych appealed to Western countries to intervene by closing Ukraine air space to Russian war planes.

“Find, please, a way,” he said. “Find a possibility. Many peaceful people died from the bombs from the sky. Please find decision to stop Russian flights.”

Angola’s government sent a plane to bring home 277 citizens who fled Ukraine. Only 30 got on it.

Teófilo Muanda braved explosions and gunfire, suffered through frigid temperatures, and endured a crowded train and a 46-mile walk, before he finally made it out of Ukraine and into Poland last week.

After finally crossing the border on Feb. 28, he was greeted by officials from Angola, who told him that a Boeing 777 was on the way to take him and others fleeing the war back to their home country.

It didn’t take long for Mr. Muanda, a 31-year-old postgraduate student in Kyiv, to decide what he would do once the plane landed in Warsaw: He was not going to get on it.

The last time he lived in Angola, he could barely make ends meet.

“Angola is my home, but I would rather stay than go through the same suffering,” he said in a phone interview from Paris, where is currently staying.

The Angolan government sent a jetliner to Warsaw to collect some 277 citizens and their families who had escaped Ukraine following the Russian military invasion. Only 30 of them got on the plane, which landed in the capital Luanda on Monday, according to the state-run news site Angop.

Interviews with four of those who stayed behind revealed their underlying concern about returning to their home country: the lack of opportunity from a crippled economy. They said they would rather take their chances to find a better life in Europe, or wait out the war, than return to an uncertain future in Angola.

Angola is an oil-rich nation of about 35 million people in southern Africa, but its economy has struggled in recent years after oil prices tumbled in 2014. The coronavirus pandemic added another layer of devastation to a country drowning in debt, much of it owed to China. Even as oil prices have rebounded over the past two years, about a third of the nation is unemployed, according to government statistics. In 2018, nearly 48 percent of the population lived on less than $1.90 per day, according to the World Bank .

A native of the coastal province of Cabinda, an outpost of Angola north of the Congo River, Mr. Muanda said he experienced significant challenges when he returned home to his country in 2018 after graduating from the Polytechnic Institute in Kharkiv. In three years, the best job he could find was at a cybercafe in Cabinda, where he made the equivalent of about $65 a month. Frustrated by that meager living, he returned to Ukraine last year.

Shortly after turning down his government’s free ride back to Angola, he fled to Paris.

“What would I return for?” he said through tears during a phone conversation.

For other Angolans, the roots they have already planted in Ukraine are too difficult to leave behind.

Felix Bote, 30, is completing degrees in oil and gas engineering and agriculture mechanics and is married to a Ukrainian woman who is still in the country. Angolan embassy officials in Poland told him that he could be arrested if he stayed in Poland, Mr. Bote said.

But if he were to return to Angola, he almost certainly would have to depend on relatives to survive, he said. So he and others said they would try to get new student visas or apply as refugees to stay in Europe.

“Make no mistake,” he said, “most in our group who stayed in Europe have the feeling that they would face a harsh reality at home.”

In an about-face, Fast Retailing, the clothing giant that owns Uniqlo, said on Thursday that the brand would stop operating in Russia. Just days earlier, the company’s founder had said it would continue to do business in the country, drawing backlash.

In the Thursday statement , Fast Retailing said it “recently faced a number of difficulties, including operational challenges and the worsening of the conflict situation.”

“Fast Retailing is strongly against any acts of hostility,” the statement continued. “We condemn all forms of aggression that violate human rights and threaten the peaceful existence of individuals.”

Tadashi Yanai, the company’s founder, previously told a Japanese newspaper: “Clothing is a necessity of life. The people of Russia have the same right to live as we do.”

Though many companies continue to operate in Russia, Mr. Yanai’s statement made Fast Retailing somewhat of an outlier among major brands and retailers . Over the last two weeks, a rising tide of businesses — which has come to include McDonald’s, Starbucks, Apple, H&M Group, Nike and Ikea — have announced plans to temporarily shutter locations or stop selling products in the country. Companies that have stayed quiet on what the mounting conflict in Ukraine means for their business have been met with criticism from both investors and consumers.

Fast Retailing first announced intentions to open stores in Russia in 2008 as part of the company’s goals to significantly boost sales by increasing the number of overseas locations.

With many of their competitors doubling prices because of high demand, the owners of the Hotel Duet in Chelm, Poland, are offering free shelter for refugees fleeing the Russian attack in Ukraine.

On the first night of the invasion, the owners, Alicja Brzozowska and Bartosz Tuszewski, decided to open their doors to Ukrainian refugees, while also collecting and providing goods donated by others in the area.

More than two million Ukrainians have fled since last month, according to the United Nations, and more are attempting to leave each day. Most have made their way to neighboring countries — Poland, Moldova and Hungary — seeking food and shelter once they get across the border to relative safety.

President Emmanuel Macron of France called the bombing of a maternity hospital in the Ukrainian port town of Mariupol a “disgraceful and amoral act of war.” Speaking to reporters at the opening of a European summit in Versailles, Macron said that Russian forces were “indiscriminately” using lethal weapons on civilian targets and that he saw no diplomatic solution to the war in coming days. “I am worried, pessimistic,” the French leader said.

LVIV, Ukraine — Russian forces continued their siege of the embattled city of Mariupol on Thursday, the day after a maternity hospital bombing that a Ukrainian official said killed three people, including a 6-year-old child.

It was the eighth day that Russian forces have bombarded the city of 430,000, a key strategic target for them on the Sea of Azov that has quickly become the site of one of the most severe humanitarian crises of the war. Most communications are cut off, people are struggling to find food and water and the authorities have been burying the dead in mass graves.

“Bombs are falling in Mariupol all the time,” said Halyna Odnoroh, an activist who managed to leave the city but whose daughter remains inside it. “Buildings are falling to the ground as if they were made of matchsticks. We need help!”

She added, “Soon Mariupol will be one big mass grave with half a million bodies!”

Satellite imagery from the city has shown significant damage to some buildings, with shopping centers and homes destroyed. The bombing of the maternity hospital on Wednesday left three people dead, the city’s deputy mayor said on Thursday, and 17 others had been injured, including women who had been in labor.

The Kremlin denied the extent of the casualties and appeared to try to legitimize the targeting of the hospital.

“It is not the first time we see pathetic outcries concerning the so-called atrocities perpetrated by the Russian military,” Foreign Minister Sergei V. Lavrov said on Thursday, after inconclusive talks with his Ukrainian counterpart in Turkey.

He said that several days ago the Russian delegation to the United Nations offered evidence that the maternity hospital had been taken over by a group of Ukrainian fighters known as the Azov battalion, “and other radicals,” and that “all the mothers about to give birth and nurses had been chased out” of the building. The Kremlin has claimed that its invasion means to achieve the “denazification” and demilitarization of Ukraine.

Photographs and videos taken after the bomb went off and testimony from eyewitnesses showed heavily pregnant women being evacuated, including one on a stretcher. Footage from inside and outside the hospital shows windows completely blown out and cars burned beyond recognition. The Russian Embassy in London tried to dismiss the photos as fake.

“Children’s hospital. Maternity hospital. What did they threaten the Russian Federation with?” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine asked in an address late Wednesday night. “What kind of country is this — the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals and maternity hospitals and destroys them?”

For days, the city has tried to organize the evacuation of women and children, but gathering places for evacuees have come under Russian fire, according to residents and people who have managed to escape.

“It’s very hard now and it’s simply unrealistic to leave,” said Anastasia Pikuz, who was able to get out several days ago but left behind her mother and disabled grandmother. She has not been able to reach them since she left on Saturday, but she has been in daily touch with her husband, who has been informing her about the situation.

“There is no way for humanitarian assistance to get in and there is no way out,” said Ms. Pikuz, 26. “They are already near the end. Some people are able to procure water from melting snow but there is no food left.”

Speaking about the destruction of her hometown, whose beaches used to draw tourists, she said, “There is almost no city left either.”

Accusations fly over Russian disinformation about biological weapons.

Russia, China and the United States continue to trade accusations of spreading disinformation about the war in Ukraine. A series of statements the last three days over allegations of chemical weapon use has become particularly testy.

A day after the White House and State Department sharply criticized Russia and China for spreading “outright lies” about the United States secretly developing biological weapons in Ukraine, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday doubled down on the accusation.

The exchange of statements underscored the intensity of the information war underway among the world’s powers.

“Russia is inventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions in Ukraine,” the State Department said in a statement, a stance that was reiterated in posts by the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, on Twitter, calling the accusations “preposterous.’’

The exchange showed the extent to which China has joined Russia as a proxy in trying to blame the United States for the conflict, even as the government in Beijing has sought to distance itself diplomatically from the carnage unfolding on the ground.

The accusation first emerged on Sunday when a spokesman for Russia’s Defense Ministry, Maj. Gen. Igor Y. Konashenkov, claimed that Russian special operations forces had discovered documents detailing Pentagon-funded “secret biological experiments” at laboratories in two Ukrainian cities, Kharkiv and Poltava.

The ministry provided copies of documents, in Ukrainian, but their veracity could not be determined.

On Tuesday, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, Zhao Lijian, used a question about the Russian accusations to accuse the United States of obfuscating about its work with biological and chemical weapons. Mr. Zhao has previously circulated conspiracy theories to deflect attention from China’s own policies, including one that linked the coronavirus pandemic not to Wuhan, where it began, but to research by the United States military at Fort Detrick, Md.

“Russia has a track record of accusing the West of the very crimes that Russia itself is perpetrating,” the State Department statement said, suggesting it could be laying the groundwork for its own attacks using prohibited weapons. “These tactics are an obvious ploy by Russia to try to justify further premeditated, unprovoked and unjustified attacks on Ukraine.”

The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank that tracks the conflict, issued its own warning on Wednesday that the Russian statements could be part of an effort to lay the groundwork for its own chemical or biological attack. “Russia may conduct or fabricate such an attack and blame Ukraine and NATO to justify additional aggression against Ukraine,” it said.

Asked on Wednesday about the American statements, Mr. Zhao did not address them. Instead, he again cited Fort Detrick and insinuated that the United States was hiding secret work with biological weapons. The day before, he called the spread of disinformation “despicable and malicious.”

On Thursday, Global Times, the Communist Party newspaper, picked up another statement from General Konashenkov, this time saying, without evidence, that the American-funded labs in Ukraine were conducting experiments with coronaviruses in bats, the presumed source of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Goldman Sachs on Thursday became the first big American bank to say it would exit Russia after Western governments imposed a raft of sanctions intended to cripple its economy. Hours later, JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in the United States, said it was winding down there, too.

Although American banks had largely pulled back from directly dealing with Russia in recent years, Goldman, JPMorgan and others still maintained limited operations to serve companies there. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted many global corporations ranging from McDonalds to Apple to shun the country.

“Goldman Sachs is winding down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements,” Andrea Williams, a spokeswoman for the bank, said in an email. “We are focused on supporting our clients across the globe in managing or closing out pre-existing obligations in the market and ensuring the well-being of our people.”

Goldman has about 80 employees in Russia and is arranging for the departures of those who have asked to leave, Ms. Williams said, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg News . Some employees in Goldman’s legal and compliance divisions will remain in the country to carry out any necessary work permitted under sanctions enacted by the United States and its allies.

JPMorgan, which holds assets for some clients in the country, is “unwinding Russian business” and is not pursuing new ventures there, Joseph Evangelisti, a company spokesman, said in a statement. The bank’s scaled-down operations also include managing Russia-related risks for clients and helping employees, he said. It has more than 100 workers in the country.

At the end of 2021, Goldman Sachs had more than $700 million in exposure to Russia, linked to loans and financial products like stocks and bonds, according to a recent regulatory filing . That’s just a small slice of the $1.5 trillion bank’s global operations.

JPMorgan’s business in Russia was not big enough to rank among its top 20 markets, according to a recent regulatory filing. The No. 20 market on its list was Mexico, with $4.9 billion in exposure. The bank has $3.7 trillion in total assets.

“None of us can fail to see this for what it is: the invasion of a sovereign state,” David M. Solomon, Goldman’s chief executive, said in a memo to employees on Thursday. “Hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee their homes, Ukrainian cities have suffered massive destruction and already there has been tragic loss of life. I know that this remains an extremely daunting and difficult time for many of our people.”

American and Western banks have pulled back from Russia since 2014, when the United States imposed penalties after President Vladimir V. Putin’s annexation of Crimea. The only major U.S. bank to keep a significant presence was Citigroup , which has about 3,000 employees there. Citigroup said on Wednesday that it would “assess our operations in the country.”

Citi’s consumer division in Russia is running limited operations; the bank put the business up for sale as part of a broader exit from overseas markets announced last year. The bank had $9.8 billion of exposure to Russia at the end of 2021, including corporate and consumer loans and local government debt securities, according to a filing . It is working to reduce that, Mark Mason, Citi’s finance chief, told investors last week.

The latest economic punishments on Russia could have far-reaching indirect consequences because of the size of its economy and its international linkages. The country is a major exporter of raw materials like oil, natural gas and wheat.

Citigroup is also the only U.S. bank with operations in Ukraine. It had more than 200 workers there and was helping those who wanted to leave to cross the border into Poland, Jane Fraser, Citigroup’s chief executive, said last week.

Russian forces are laying siege to the northern Ukraine city of Chernihiv, the mayor says.

LVIV, Ukraine — Russian forces have encircled and are laying siege to the ancient city of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, the mayor said, adding that critical infrastructure for its 300,000 residents was rapidly failing as it came under repeated bombardment.

“We are surrounded,” the mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko, said in an online statement. While Ukrainian forces are battling to keep some roads in and out open, the mayor said, Russian forces are trying to tighten a cordon around the city.

The mayor, in a message posted online on Wednesday, said the rising death toll from the fighting meant his city has run out of room to bury its dead. “This is the first time in my life when I have to excavate the graves to bury five coffins together,” the mayor said.

The entire city is without gas for cooking and heating, the mayor reported, after Russian shelling destroyed the pipes. Some neighborhoods have no clean water, he said, and the city has been disconnected from the national power grid, forcing residents to use their remaining gas supplies to keep the lights on. That gas supply is expected to run out in 24 hours, the mayor said.

Mr. Atroshenko has posted urgent pleas for help on the local government website over the past couple of days. “Dozens of people have died,” he said in one message. “Dozens of multistory buildings have been ruined. Thousands of people have no place to live.”

Chernihiv lies directly along the Russian invasion route from Belarus to Kyiv. It has come under attack since the first days of the war and managed to repulse an earlier attempt to capture it. But the Russian bombardment has intensified in recent days, according to local officials, eyewitness accounts and video evidence.

Russian forces also have besieged the southern port city of Mariupol for more than a week, and the situation there has grown increasingly dire. People are being buried in communal graves.

The Chernihiv Regional Military Administration issued a report on Thursday documenting an attack on Wednesday night, in which it accused Russian forces of opening fire in a residential community on the outskirts of the city. At least 10 houses were burned.

“During the last few days Chernihiv is being under violent severe bombings of Russian fighting aircrafts,” the mayor said. “Up to 17 bombings per day.”

Still, he said the city had no plans to surrender. “Everyone is looking at us,” he said. “We have to be strong.”

Russia’s disinformation machine is hard at work in its home territory.

Russia’s international disinformation campaign seemed to flounder in the early days of the invasion, as narratives about Ukrainian bravery dominated the internet . But in Russia, the country’s propaganda machine was busy churning out a deluge of misinformation aimed at its own citizens.

The narrative disseminated online through state-run and unofficial channels has helped create an alternate reality where the invasion is justified and Ukrainians are to blame for violence. To control the narrative at home, Russia also shut down access to several websites and threatened the news media with long prison sentences for criticizing the war. There’s some evidence that the effort has mollified at least some Russians .

Here is what the war looks like to Russians, based on a review of state news articles, channels on the popular chat app Telegram, and input from several disinformation watchdogs who are monitoring Russia’s propaganda machine.
After Russian shellings killed Ukrainian civilians, Russia blamed ‘neo-Nazis.’
A headline from the Russian state news website Tass.

Some of the most disturbing images from the war have come from Mariupol, a port city in the southeastern coast. Shelling battered the region, killing several civilians who were trying to flee the area, during what was supposed to be a cease-fire.

But Russians got a different explanation online: Ukrainians had fired on Russian forces during the cease-fire, and neo-Nazis were “hiding behind civilians as a human shield,” according to the Russian state news website Tass.

Neo-Nazis have been a recurring character in Russian propaganda campaigns for years, used to falsely justify military action against Ukraine in what Russian officials have called “denazification.” Those claims have only continued during the conflict. To explain away attacks on other Ukrainian apartment buildings, the same article by Tass claimed that neo-Nazis had placed “heavy weapons in apartment buildings, while some residents are forcibly kept in their homes,” providing no evidence.

Russian social media accounts have used a mix of fake and unconfirmed photos showing Ukrainian soldiers holding Nazi flags or photos of Hitler. An analysis by the Center for Information Resilience, a nonprofit focused on identifying disinformation, showed that the number of tweets connecting Ukrainians to Nazis soared after the invasion began.

“Propaganda works when it coincides with your existing assumptions,” said Pierre Vaux, a senior investigator at the Center for Information Resilience. “The stuff that chimes into the Nazi stuff is really effective.”
After a nuclear facility caught fire, Russians claimed they were protecting it.
A headline from the Russian state news website Tass.
Translated into English. Tap Hover for the original.

After Russia attacked an area near the nuclear complex in Zaporizhzhia, leading to a fire , President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called it “ nuclear terrorism .”

But according to a Kremlin statement reported in Tass, the military seized the facility to prevent Ukrainians and neo-Nazis from “organizing provocations fraught with catastrophic consequences.” Even though Ukrainians heavily fortified the region against an attack, Russian officials claimed they already had control of the compound before Ukrainians opened fire. They added that Ukrainians set fire to an adjacent building before fleeing, providing no evidence. Western experts said controlling the Zaporizhzhia complex would allow Russia to trigger blackouts or shut down the entire power grid.

The image of Russia as a world protector surfaced again after the country’s officials claimed they discovered evidence that Ukraine was working on a nuclear bomb. According to Russian officials, plans for the bomb were uncovered at the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

“It doesn’t even make sense, because if you’re going to develop a nuclear weapon, you don’t do your secret development in a nuclear power plant,” Mr. Vaux said. “But that kind of thing is just being beamed out on Russian state TV.”
After Russia shelled a residential neighborhood, Russians claimed Ukrainians did it.

An attack on Kharkiv, a northeast Ukraine city bordering Russia, provided additional evidence that Russia had indiscriminately bombed residential neighborhoods and killed civilians, according to the Atlantic Council , an American research group. The International Criminal Court opened an investigation into war crimes after the assault.

In one attack that included heavy shelling , 34 civilians were killed and 285 were injured, according to the Ukrainian State Emergency Service.
A post from the Telegram channel for the Russian news site Readovka.
Translated into English. Tap Hover for the original.

But Russians listening to state media or browsing channels on Telegram heard another story: The missiles, those sources claimed, came from Ukrainian territory.

On a Telegram channel for the Russian news site Readovka, one post described how “Ukrainian missiles” had “arrived from the northwest” — an area controlled by the Ukrainian military.

Russia’s defense department said that it never attacked cities, instead targeting “military infrastructure” with “high-precision weapons,” according to an article in the state-owned news agency RIA Novosti.
After attacks bloodied civilians, Russians called injured Ukrainians crisis actors.

A woman who survived a blast at her apartment building became the focus of disinformation efforts after her bloodied and bandaged photograph spread widely through newspapers and Western media.

The woman was a resident of an apartment complex in Chuhuiv, near Kharkiv. The photojournalist Alex Lourie captured her portrait after the attack, and the image was soon featured on the front pages of newspapers around the world.
A post from the Telegram channel War on Fakes.
Translated into English. Tap Hover for the original.

But Russian social media channels falsely described her as a member of Ukraine’s psychological operations unit, according to an analysis by the Ukrainian fact-checking website StopFake .

A post by “War on Fakes,” a pro-Russian website and Telegram channel that appeared at the start of the invasion, suggested that the blood could be grape juice and that the woman could be “part of the territorial defense.” As evidence, the post included a shot of another woman bearing some resemblance. That image came from a New York Times photograph , which was taken in Kyiv — a seven-hour drive west of Chuhuiv.

The top economic adviser to the Ukrainian government called on Thursday for a full, global embargo on Russian oil and gas, describing the payments for Russia’s energy products as “blood money.”

The adviser, Oleg Ustenko, made the plea as he outlined the steep economic costs that Russia’s invasion is having on Ukraine’s economy as the country faces relentless bombardment. He estimated that $100 billion worth of Ukrainian assets have been lost and destroyed so far.

“The situation is a disaster that is really much deeper than somebody can imagine,” Mr. Ustenko said at a Peterson Institute for International Economics virtual event . “What is really needed to be done is to introduce a full embargo worldwide on Russian oil and gas. This is blood money.”

The country’s business sector has been crippled, Mr. Ustenko said, with 50 percent of businesses not operating and those that are running at less than full capacity. He added that Ukraine’s financial system and currency remained stable, given the circumstances.

The cost of building that Ukraine will face when it emerges from the war will be vast, Mr. Ustenko said.

The International Monetary Fund’s executive board approved $1.4 billion of emergency financing for Ukraine on Wednesday. The World Bank is also working to deploy a $500 million supplemental loan to help support Ukraine’s economy. And in the United States, the House approved $13.6 billion in emergency aid for Ukraine on Wednesday.

Mr. Ustenko said that beyond military support, Ukrainians will need aid for food, clothing and other basic needs.

As he called for a full embargo on Russian oil and gas, Mr. Ustenko said that he believed that the sanctions that were in place were working to cripple Russia’s economy.

“We are destroying them economically,” Mr. Ustenko said. “And destroying Russia economically maybe even has the same importance as the ground operation now.”

Yad Vashem, Israel’s official Holocaust memorial, announced on Thursday that “in light of recent developments,” it has decided to suspend its strategic partnership with Roman Abramovich, the Russian oligarch, hours after the British government seized his assets as part of a wider set of sanctions against a group of wealthy Russian businessmen. Abramovich’s partnership with Yad Vashem was announced on Feb. 22, two days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine and involved an eight-figure charitable pledge to bolster Holocaust research, according to a spokesman for Yad Vashem.

Mitarachi gave no details about when Greece would send the aircraft, nor how many refugees the country would take in. Some 7,000 Ukrainians have reached Greece so far, he said.

Britain plans to streamline its visa process for Ukrainians with family in the U.K.

LONDON — Britain on Thursday announced a streamlined visa process for Ukrainian refugees hoping to join family in the United Kingdom. The changes are set to take effect next week, the British home secretary, Priti Patel, said in an address to Parliament.

Ukrainians fleeing war-torn cities have overwhelmed U.K. visa application centers in Europe because they had been instructed to submit part of their applications online and submit biometric data in person before they could get visas. The shift, which will begin on Tuesday, means that Ukrainian family members can apply for visas online, but, once approved, travel to Britain and have their biometric data taken there.

Britain’s visa approach is out of line with that of the European Union, which it exited in early 2020. The bloc has allowed all Ukrainians, regardless of family connections, to enter immediately, visa free, while fleeing the war.

Britain’s plans will not take effect until nearly three weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, so far driving more than two million people from their homes in the swiftest and largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The shift in Britain is likely to ease the burden on U.K. visa application centers in Europe, where hundreds had been lining up for hours in the cold. But it does not address criticism from European leaders, opposition lawmakers and family members that visas are required at all.

During a question-and-answer session on Wednesday in Parliament, Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested that Britain would offer another humanitarian route to Ukrainian refugees, regardless of family connections. But no details on that process or when it would begin have been released.
