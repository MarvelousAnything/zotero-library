Madmen like Putin who sanction killing of children shouldn't be appeased: Gowdy</h2></div><div class="content"><p>There
 is a lot going on in the country, in the world. And when there's a lot 
going on, it's the perfect time to think and analyze and ask questions 
starting with ourselves. The answers, I think, will eventually come — or
 partial answers will eventually come — if we do spend enough time 
reflecting and analyzing and posing the right questions to those in 
positions of power and also to ourselves.</p><p>So, we'll start with 
what's been on my mind, which is that Russia invaded a sovereign 
neighboring country, and civilians are being 
killed.&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ukrainian&nbsp;civilians are bearing 
the cost of wars waged by a Russian despot, which should lead us to 
wonder why there has been any equivocation by some in this country on 
the nature and intentions of&nbsp;Vladimir Putin.</p><p>

 children should settle the question of who Putin is once and for all. 
It's not something I've wondered about, but it is apparently something 
that others have wondered about. And it does beg the question of what 
some people are drawn to.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/madmen-putin-russia-ukraine-gowdy" target="_blank" data-omtr-intcmp="lb_russia-ukraine-war:-united-nations-approves-resolution-condemning-putin,-russia:-live-updates_postclickthru_68_article2 ">Read more.</a></p></div><div class="meta meta-lower"><span class="author">Posted by Michael Lee </span><a href="#" class="share">Share</a></div></article><article class="article-item" id="post-67" data-post-id=""><div class="meta meta-upper"><time class="time" datetime="Wed Mar 02 2022 18:12:22 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)"></time><h2 class="title">The many sides of 'world hero' Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2></div><div class="content"><p></p><div class="post-video-container" data-video-id="6299434780001"></div><p></p></div><div class="meta meta-lower"><span class="author">Posted by Michael Lee </span><a href="#" class="share">Share</a></div></article><div class="ad-container desktop ad-h-50 ad-w-300"><div class="ad gam" id="desk-ad-lb9"></div><script>window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike){

The protests in Russia started immediately and continued despite a swift
 and severe crackdown by police in every major city, including the 
capital of Moscow and the city of St. Petersburg. The arrests come as 
Russian leaders continue to be frustrated by slower-than-expected gains 
in their invasion of Ukraine, according to American officials.</p><p>In a
 long series of tweets posted Wednesday by his spokesman, Navalny called
 for his people to avoid turning into a "nation of frightened silent 
people" and instead "fight for peace."&nbsp;</p><p>"I call on everyone 
to take to the streets and fight for peace," he wrote. "Putin is not 
Russia. And if there is anything in Russia right now that you can be 
most proud of, it is those 6,824 people who were detained because – 
without any call – they took to the streets with placards saying ‘No
