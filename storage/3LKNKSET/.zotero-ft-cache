The  Ukraine  Ministry of Foreign Affairs is calling on Russia to stop killing individuals in Kharkiv and Sumy to allow for evacuations to take place, saying that students are currently "hostages" of the Russian government.

International students from countries such as India, Pakistan, and China are currently unable to leave the cities because of "indiscriminate shelling and barbaric missile strikes by the Russian Armed Forces on residential areas and civilian infrastructure," according to the Facebook post made on Wednesday.

The government agency said it would assist international students in relocating the students to safer areas if a ceasefire is arranged, but said that current evacuations are extremely difficult.

Madmen like Putin who sanction killing of children shouldn't be appeased: Gowdy

There is a lot going on in the country, in the world. And when there's a lot going on, it's the perfect time to think and analyze and ask questions starting with ourselves. The answers, I think, will eventually come — or partial answers will eventually come — if we do spend enough time reflecting and analyzing and posing the right questions to those in positions of power and also to ourselves.

So, we'll start with what's been on my mind, which is that Russia invaded a sovereign neighboring country, and civilians are being killed. Russian and Ukrainian civilians are bearing the cost of wars waged by a Russian despot, which should lead us to wonder why there has been any equivocation by some in this country on the nature and intentions of Vladimir Putin.

Some in the media and in positions of power seem frankly enamored with Putin. Looking at the images of dead Ukrainian children should settle the question of who Putin is once and for all. It's not something I've wondered about, but it is apparently something that others have wondered about. And it does beg the question of what some people are drawn to.

Kherson becomes the first major Ukrainian city to fall to the Russian invasion

The southern Ukrainian city of Kherson has fallen to Russian forces, becoming the first major city to fall since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last week.

“There is no Ukrainian army here,” Kherson Mayor Igor Kolykhaev said Wednesday, according to the New York Times. “The city is surrounded.”

Kolykhaev said that Ukrainian forces have pulled out of the city and relocated to the area of Mykolaiv, a city northwest of Kherson.

Kherson, a city of 300,000 people that sits nears the Black Sea, is an important strategically thanks to its location near Ukraine's southern coast, giving the Russian military more control of the area as they attempt to push towards the major port city of Odessa.

Russian missile lands near Kyiv central train station where many are trying to flee city

A Russian missile landed near Kyiv's central train station Wednesday evening, sources tell Fox News Digital.

Photos show huge crowds in the area earlier in the day as refugees -- many of them women and children -- attempted to escape the violence as Russian troops mass outside the city.

The strike came after sundown. There were no immediate reports of injuries, however the sources said trains were still running at the time of the attack. Video shared to social media show damaged windows at the train station on the side facing a parking lot. A handful of people appeared OK inside.

Sources said it fell about 300 to 400 meters from the train station itself.

Ukrainian defense forces have been setting up makeshift fortifications and barricades, as military checkpoints searched incoming cars for Russian saboteurs.

The attack came as Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure have intensified around the country -- especially in the besieged city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which is near the border with Russia.

On Tuesday, another Russian missile took down a civilian TV tower in Kyiv, killing at least five people.

"Just luck that nobody was killed. When you attack with missiles, you aim to kill," the source told Fox News Digital.

Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has urged the people of his country to stage daily protests and calls President Vladimir Putin an "obviously insane czar" for his invasion of Ukraine .  

The protests in Russia started immediately and continued despite a swift and severe crackdown by police in every major city, including the capital of Moscow and the city of St. Petersburg. The arrests come as Russian leaders continue to be frustrated by slower-than-expected gains in their invasion of Ukraine, according to American officials.

In a long series of tweets posted Wednesday by his spokesman, Navalny called for his people to avoid turning into a "nation of frightened silent people" and instead "fight for peace." 

"I call on everyone to take to the streets and fight for peace," he wrote. "Putin is not Russia. And if there is anything in Russia right now that you can be most proud of, it is those 6,824 people who were detained because – without any call – they took to the streets with placards saying ‘No War’."

Disturbing photos and videos have emerged from Ukraine on Wednesday as the largest city of Kharkiv continued to endure relentless shelling on the seventh day since Russian forces invaded.

The air assault on overpopulated urban areas of Ukraine continued even as Moscow said it would be ready to resume talks aimed at stopping the new devastating war in Europe.

In Kharkiv, with a population of about 1.5 million, at least six people were killed when the region’s administrative building on Freedom Square was hit with what was believed to be a missile. 

The Slovenian Foreign Ministry said its consulate in Kharkiv, located in another large building on the square, was destroyed. The attack on the square — the nucleus of public life in the city — was seen by many Ukrainians as brazen evidence that the Russian invasion wasn’t just about hitting military targets.

China is 'big winner' of Russia-Ukraine war, former FBI agent who worked in China says

Steve Gray explained why he says China gains the biggest advantage in the Russia-Ukraine war.

China may emerge as the primary beneficiary of the Russia-Ukraine war , a former FBI special agent who worked on China and North Korea told Fox News Digital.

"Ultimately, China is the big winner in the Russia-Ukraine War," Steve Gray, a former FBI special agent who is running for Congress in New Jersey's 4th Congressional District, said.

"They’ll be the primary beneficiary of the sanctions against Russia , the yen will benefit from the decline of the ruble, and they have been given a case study of what the world’s response would look like if they were to invade Taiwan."

"It would not be surprising at all to learn that this is shaping up exactly as China planned," Gray, who spent 10 years working as a supervisory special agent focused on China and North Korea, added.

Russian forces have increased their attacks on crowded Ukraine urban area s, including bombing a TV tower in the capital of Kyiv and continued shelling in Kharkiv.

And, "President Biden must make clear that the United States will continue to stand with the freedom-loving Ukrainian people should their country be overtaken by Russian forces not just with words but bullets."
