bank account through the bank ATMs.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">“The majority of ATMs (of this bank) don’t work to deposit (money),” Biryukova said. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Food prices, according to some businesses, have started soaring, too. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">“All
 the main ingredients we prepare our products from have gone up in price
 by 30-40%,” said Ilya Oktavin, who runs delivery service at a Perm 
sushi bar.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Certain
 goods are also harder to come by because of actions by companies like 
Nike, which on Tuesday night halted online sales with a statement on the
 company’s website saying it “can’t guarantee delivery of the goods to 
shoppers in Russia.” On Wednesday, H&amp;M announced suspending “all 
sales” in the country.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Kremlin critics are painting a bleak picture for Russia. </p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-92"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-50">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-53"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-51"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle2" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-49"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">“We’re
 facing growing prices, mass layoffs, delays in payment of benefits or

Wednesday. “Shortages of medicines and medical equipment. Aging and 
impoverished car and aircraft fleet. ... We’ll be remembering the 1990s 
as hardly the worst time. But I have only one question: for what?”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">In
 what looked like an effort to prevent panic, Russian authorities on 
Tuesday launched a special website, titled “We’re explaining,” that 
talks about how various areas of life are functioning under the pressure
 of sanctions. Worrying reports, like the ones anticipating a spike in 
prices, or saying that certain services don’t work, are debunked on the 
website as “fake.” </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Some
 Russians, in the meantime, say that it’s not so much the sanctions that
 worry them, but the deadly attack Russia waged on a neighboring 
country. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">“You 
know, sanctions bother me the least. I’m worried about Russia killing 
people in Ukraine,” said Moscow resident Ivan Kozlov. “I wish it stopped
 the war no sane person with a conscience and capable of mercy and 
compassion in Russia wants.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88"><a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-europe-arrests-moscow-cf5dda5528937de907f8916820cfab75">Anti-war sentiment in Russia</a><!-- -->

The study found that it wouldn’t be possible for the cooling water to reach boiling temperature and the fuel rods would not be uncovered to start a real meltdown, Lyman said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE PHYSICS OF COOLING FUEL RODS\u003c/p>\u003cp>When fuel rods are spent after generating power, they still have lots of internal radioactivity and are still hot. Internal radioactive decay gives off heat and remains in the fuel rods for tens of thousands of years, so they can get hotter unless something is done to cool them, Regan said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The rods are put in cooling pools or ponds where both water and an active electric-powered system cools them with a heat exchange pump.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“As soon as you stop the coolant, as soon as you stop the mechanism for taking the heat off, it (temperature) will increase,” Regan said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Eventually in most plants, the radioactivity and heat subsides enough that it could eventually switch from water cooling to air cooling.\u003c/p>\u003cp>NO IMMEDIATE DANGER SEEN\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority estimates that a power outage at Chernobyl will not lead to any radiological emissions in the next couple weeks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The fuel storage ponds are also very deep and would likely take weeks for the water to boil down, even without cooling pumps active. This should hopefully allow enough time for the power to cooling systems to be restored,” said Mark Wenman, a nuclear energy expert at Imperial College London.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The IAEA, which is the U.N. nuclear watchdog based in Vienna, said it saw no critical impact on safety at Chernobyl because there could be “effective heat removal without need for electrical supply” from spent nuclear fuel at the site.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lyman and others said they were more concerned about potential damage to cooling systems and other problems at Ukraine's four other operating nuclear power plants, rather than at the defunct Chernobyl site. In 2017, Chernobyl got a new 2 billion euro containment system to go over the old sarcophagus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>OTHER CONCERNS\u003c/p>\u003cp>The post-Fukushima study did raise issues about hydrogen gas being generated and pooling from the cooling process, which is removed with an electronic system, Lyman said. The concern is that the explosive gas may pool more without the venting system and lead to dangers, including sparks when electricity is turned back on if it ever stops.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Another issue is that lack of electricity means the IAEA’s monitoring system, for safety and security, will be blinded, Lyman said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s not just the cooling to the pools, but all the off-site radiation monitoring systems have been lost,” Lyman said. “The IAEA doesn’t have cameras anymore.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>He described the overall situation as not good, but said it isn’t an immediate emergency. There are layers of safety that help, but the lack of power peels some of those away.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s limping along with kind of less resilience,” Lyman said. “So if something else does happen, there’s less margin.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Given that experts say a major radioactive release is weeks to months away, if at all, the biggest consequence of the power shutoff or targeting of nuclear plants in the war is fear, said Emma Claire Foley, a policy researcher on U.S.-Russian nuclear policy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“People hear ‘Chernobyl’ and think ‘nuclear disaster,’” Foley said. “It does cause fear. And it does cause a sense of uncertainty.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>If anything bad did happen, Ukraine's neighbor of Belarus, a Russian ally, “would need to be more concerned than anyone else” because of its proximity to the Chernobyl site, said University of Southern California nuclear engineering professor Najmedin Meshkati. The Belarus border is less than 10 miles from Chernobyl, while the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) south of the plant,\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Belarus got the brunt of the Chernobyl impact” from the radioactive cloud released in 1986, he said, adding that Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko should “take the lead in begging Mr. Putin to stop military operations around Chernobyl.”\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-science","name":"Science","canonicalName":"science","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false},{"id":"Nuclearpower","name":"Nuclear power","canonicalName":"nuclear-power","isPr":false},{"id":"Accidents","name":"Accidents","canonicalName":"accidents","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-WorldNews","name":"World News","canonicalName":"world-news","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"InternationalAtomicEnergyAgency","name":"International Atomic Energy Agency","canonicalName":"international-atomic-energy-agency","isPr":false},{"id":"UnitedNations","name":"United Nations","canonicalName":"united-nations","isPr":false},{"id":"Physics","name":"Physics","canonicalName":"physics","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:bf2bcfb3a499d688e3075f2d4cf54989","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:bf2bcfb3a499d688e3075f2d4cf54989","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:bf2bcfb3a499d688e3075f2d4cf54989","shortId":"bf2bcfb3a499d688e3075f2d4cf54989","bylines":"By EVGENIY MALOLETKA and MSTYSLAV CHERNOV","canonicalUrl":"russia-ukraine-boris-johnson-business-europe-united-nations","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":{},"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":null,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>MARIUPOL, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian airstrike on a Mariupol maternity hospital that killed three people drew outrage on Thursday, with Ukrainian and British officials branding it a war crime.

Explosions blew out windows and ripped away much of the front of one building.

He said Russian President Vladimir Putin could meet with Zelenskyy but only after further negotiations about Russia’s broader grievances.
