Latest Developments

In Ukraine: Moscow launched a fresh assault on the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, a day after one of its planes bombed a maternity hospital , illustrating how Russia is ramping up a violent push to take strategic towns, at a high cost for civilians.

On the 15th day of fighting, Ukrainian authorities raised the casualty count of Wednesday’s hospital bombing to three dead and 17 wounded.

Cease-Fire Talks: The two top diplomats from Russia and Ukraine failed to agree on a cease-fire during a 90-minute meeting in Turkey, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. But there were signs that Russia’s position could be shifting.

Markets: U.S. stocks declined and oil prices reversed early gains, as cease-fire talks between Russia and Ukraine yielded little progress and inflation readings reached a 40-year high.

Chief of U.S. Energy Regulator Gives Climate Endorsement to Natural Gas
By Timothy Puko

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman Thursday became the latest federal official to endorse natural gas as a potential benefit for the climate, as the Biden administration scrambles to get more of the fuel to needy European allies .

Industry officials have questioned whether the Biden administration’s commitment to cleaner fuels would hinder the development of gas-export terminals at a time when Europe wants more Western fuel as a bulwark against Russian aggression. But several times at the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston this week, Washington officials have said gas has a place in the future energy mix.

That started at the first appearance Monday, when presidential climate adviser John Kerry endorsed gas as an important export to the developing world. FERC Commission Chairman Richard Glick, a Democrat, said on Thursday that such judgments should be on a case-by-case basis, and oftentimes, he said, they will show a benefit for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.

“If you are going to export natural gas and it's going to reduce coal-fired generation in Poland, for instance, that actually is a net-positive,” Mr. Glick said while speaking to reporters. “I'm just going to give you my personal opinion, which is that I think to the extent you're replacing a dirtier fuel it actually is a positive for climate change.”

FERC has been under fire for a vote last month to give more weight to the environmental concerns over new natural-gas pipelines when deciding whether to approve them, as the White House was warning that Russia may launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Industry leaders have said that could delay new pipelines and export terminals.

Mr. Glick disputed those claims, saying the agency is trying to craft a better permitting process that is both faster and likely to avert lengthy legal disputes. He also said it is working with the Energy Department to help Europe, including with efforts to speed up the pipeline permitting process to open more capacity for U.S. natural gas.

“We're looking at what can we do--what can we do to provide more certainty in the siting process not only for pipelines but for LNG [liquefied natural gas] facilities,” he said.

He also said FERC had never rejected a terminal application and that of 18 approved, only nine have been built. That has led him, while in Houston, to ask companies why more permit approvals haven’t led to more completed projects.
Europe to Weigh Emergency Measures to Limit Electricity Prices

The European Union should consider emergency measures in the coming weeks that could include temporary limits on electricity prices, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told leaders at an EU summit in Versailles. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has highlighted the vulnerability of Europe’s energy supplies and raised fears that imports could be cut off by Moscow or because of damage to pipelines that run across Ukraine

IAEA Struggles to Kickstart Ukraine, Russia Accord on Ukraine Nuclear Facilities
By Laurence Norman

United Nations atomic agency chief Rafael Grossi held talks in Turkey on Thursday with the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine in the hopes of kick-starting an agreement to safeguard Ukraine’s nuclear facilities amid Russia’s invasion of the country.

However, it was plain from a press conference he gave on his return to Vienna that crafting an agreement is going to be a tough task.

Mr. Grossi’s initiative comes after a series of incidents at Ukraine’s nuclear facilities including a loss of power at the Chernobyl site , a fire at Ukraine’s largest nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia caused by a Russian missile and the trapping of more than 200 staff at Chernobyl, which is now under the control of Russian forces, who have not been permitted to leave the site and go home.

On Thursday evening, the IAEA reported that Ukraine's nuclear regulator had now lost all connections with staff at Chernobyl. A day earlier, the agency said the regulator was still able to maintain contact by email.

On the positive side, Mr. Grossi said that both Russia and Ukraine were “ready and disposed to work” with the IAEA on a plan to keep Ukraine’s nuclear sites clear from fighting, ensure important safety equipment can reach the sites and potentially send International Atomic Energy Agency experts to help secure them.

“We are going to be presenting quite detailed ideas to both sides in the coming hours,” Mr. Grossi said.

There were indications that an agreement which could be quickly applied amid the fighting will be hard to nail down.

For starters, Ukraine and Russia declined to meet together with IAEA, forcing Mr. Grossi to hold separate talks with both sides. Mr. Grossi said it might end up being necessary to craft two separate bilateral agreements, one with Russia and one with Ukraine, to agree steps to secure nuclear facilities.

Ukraine is also demanding Russian withdrawal of forces from Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia before there is any agreement to secure the facilities, a demand that will likely be a tough sell for Moscow, whose military spent days fighting to get control of the sites.

Russia is saying it’s open to further talks but insists they should not be in Ukraine, as Mr. Grossi has proposed.

Asked if he had received any promise from Ukraine and Russia that they would stop fighting near nuclear facilities, Mr. Grossi said “the answer would be no because we were not discussing in detail” the framework to be agreed. He said there is a high probability of a follow-up meeting very soon.

Meanwhile, the situation at the two captured Ukrainian nuclear facilities continues to deteriorate.

Power cuts to Chernobyl have continued and Mr. Grossi said there had been no confirmation of reports that Belarus authorities had ordered electricity to be provided to Chernobyl to prevent any problems there. So far, none of the nuclear-related incidents in Ukraine have led to unusual or dangerous radioactive releases.

Mr. Grossi said the agency is also without answers on why the IAEA is no longer receiving safeguards data from equipment the agency has at Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia. The information provides the IAEA with the ability to monitor activities at the sites to ensure no nuclear material or equipment is being diverted for illicit uses.

Mr. Grossi said the loss of information may be explained by the power cuts at the sites and that there are other sources of information the agency can access to make sure nothing is amiss. But the IAEA chief warned that he had growing concerns that the agency could lose the ability to ensure that the sites are being used for solely peaceful purposes.

“Gradually we are losing…a significant amount of information,” Mr. Grossi said.
Some Big U.K., U.S. Law Firms Shut Down Moscow Offices
By Richard Vanderford

Top law firms have begun to pull out of Russia in response to the conflict in Ukraine, moving beyond earlier moves to limit their work in the country.

Clifford Chance LLP, a leading U.K.-based firm, said Thursday it has begun an "orderly wind down" of its operations in Moscow after earlier saying it wouldn't accept new work from Russian state-backed entities. Allen & Overy LLP, another member of London's so-called Magic Circle of leading law firms, also said Thursday it would wind down its Moscow office, which opened in 1993.

London-based Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, which has had a Moscow presence for 30 years, said Wednesday it would close its office there despite the impact the decision would have on "our valued colleagues in Russia."

Chicago-based Winston & Strawn LLP is shutting down its Moscow office out of a "sense of solidarity with the Ukrainian people," Chairman Tom Fitzgerald said Thursday.

The law firms join other professional-services firms in what has become a wide-scale departure from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine last month.
Kamala Harris Embraces Efforts to Investigate Russia for Possible War Crimes in Ukraine

U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris threw her support behind efforts to investigate Russia for possible war crimes in Ukraine, saying the U.S. would work with international efforts that are under way. Ms. Harris, a former prosecutor, stopped short of calling Russia’s actions “war crimes,” while Polish President Andrzej Duda, speaking alongside her, did so twice.

EU Should Leave Door Open to Ukraine, Macron Says

VERSAILLES, France—French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday it would be unfair for the European Union to close the membership door for Ukraine, but warned the bloc couldn’t open an accession process with a country at war.

Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia each formally applied for EU membership last week as they sought to deepen their ties with the West in reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, EU membership negotiations usually take a decade or more and include broad domestic economic, judicial and political demands.

“We need to send a strong signal in this period to Ukraine and Ukrainians,” Mr. Macron said speaking to reporters ahead of a meeting with other EU leaders at the Versailles Palace near Paris on Thursday. “At the same time, we need to be vigilant. Can we open a membership procedure with a country at war? I don’t think so,” he added.

EU member states have soured in recent years on enlargement although they are in negotiations with some western Balkan countries on joining the club.

"There is no such thing as a fast tracking of accession. It doesn’t exist," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Thursday. "EU accession for Ukraine is something for the long term, if at all," he added.

Mr. Macron warned that the war in Ukraine will have a significant impact on Europe’s future. It will “redefine the architecture of our Europe,” he said.
Biden Calls Colombia a Major Non-NATO Ally, Praises Ukraine Cooperation

President Biden declared Colombia a major non-NATO ally Thursday during a meeting with Colombian President Ivan Duque, calling the designation a “recognition of the unique and close relationship between our countries.”

The two leaders met at the White House, where Mr. Biden stressed the countries' close ties and thanked Mr. Duque for immediately condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“The American people and the entire world have rallied to support the Ukrainian people,” he said, citing the humanitarian aid and economic sanctions he said were crippling the Russian economy, as well as the additional funding for Ukraine in an omnibus spending bill .

“Ukraine will never, never be a victory for Putin,” Mr. Biden said. “Colombia is a keystone to our shared efforts to build a hemisphere as prosperous, secure and democratic.”

Mr. Biden also called for a new framework for managing migration, with a goal of signing a declaration in June at the Summit of Americas. And he said an additional two million Covid-19 vaccine doses would be sent to the country.

The two leaders didn't raise the subject of Venezuelan oil in their comments to reporters, but Colombia has been a persistent critic of the Venezuelan government. The U.S. has in recent days shifted its approach by engaging in talks with Venezuela about lifting sanctions on its oil industry.

Mr. Duque said he appreciated the non-NATO ally designation and the U.S. donation of vaccine doses to Columbia. More than a dozen other countries are considered to be major non-NATO allies, a designation that signifies their close defense, trade and security ties to the U.S. The White House also announced the designation of Qatar as a major non-NATO ally Thursday.

Mr. Duque said Russia's attack on Ukraine was brutal and unjustified. It is “a very horrifying moment for the world and we have to condemn with a very strong sentiment,” he said.
JPMorgan Actively Unwinding Russian Business

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is actively unwinding its Russian business to comply with global sanctions against the country, a bank spokeswoman said Thursday.

The biggest U.S. bank said its current activities in Russia have been limited and focused on helping global corporate clients with their own exit plans and risks and the storing of assets, as well as humanitarian aid and employee assistance, the spokeswoman said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said earlier Thursday it was planning an exit from Russia , while Citigroup Inc. has said it is evaluating its future .

JPMorgan’s presence in Russia is relatively small and involves both investment banking operations and banking services for clients in Russia, mostly international companies. Those operations are harder to close and the exit will not be as swift as the corporations who are closing.

The bank’s lending and investment exposure to Russia hasn’t ranked among the biggest 20 countries it operates in since 2015, when it and rivals cut back business following Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The lack of disclosure implies JPMorgan has less than $4.9 billion in exposure to the country.

Walt Disney Co. said Thursday it is taking steps to pause all other businesses in Russia, a move that comes after it paused the release of films in Russia.

The company said the latest move extends to content and product licensing, Disney Cruise Line activities, National Geographic magazine and tours, local content productions and linear channels.

Disney said some business activities will be paused immediately, while others such as linear channels and some content and product licensing will take time due to contractual complexities.

The company said it remains committed to its colleagues in Russia, who will remain employed, even as it pauses these businesses.
