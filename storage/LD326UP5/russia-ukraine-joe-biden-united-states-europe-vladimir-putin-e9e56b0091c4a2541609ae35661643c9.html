 weeks of saying the U.S. wasn’t sure if Putin had made a final decision
 to launch an invasion, Biden said Friday he’s now convinced he has and 
it could occur in the “coming days.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">He said an invasion could include an assault on the capital, Kyiv. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Biden said he was confident in the new assessment because of the Americans’ “significant intelligence capability.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">In
 an interview with ABC News, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin backed up 
Biden’s claim. Asked about the potential for a Russian invasion, Austin 
said, “I don’t believe it’s a bluff.” </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">WHAT SANCTIONS WOULD RUSSIA FACE?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The
 U.S. has decided to hold off on at least one of the most crushing 
financial options available to punish Russia if it invades Ukraine, 
Deputy National Economic Council Director Daleep Singh told reporters at
 a White House briefing Friday.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Booting
 Russia out of the SWIFT financial system that moves money around the 
world was one of the most damaging steps the U.S. could take against the
 Russian economy, but it is opposed by some European allies for the 
spillover damage it would cause to their economies as well.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Asked
 Friday if Americans and their European allies — many of them more 
exposed to any collateral damage from sanctions hitting Russia’s economy
 — were on the same page on specific financial penalties, Biden said he 
expected “slight” differences.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-92"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-50">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-53"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-51"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle2" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-49"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Singh
 described sanctions against Russian financial institutions and 
state-owned enterprises, as well as U.S. export controls that would deny
 Russia advanced technology it seeks for its industry and military.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">At
 a time of high oil and gas prices, the U.S. also did not intend to try 
to block Russian energy from reaching global markets, he said, but gave 
no details.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Italy,
 which is heavily reliant on Russian gas, has pushed for energy to be 
kept out of any sanctions. Italian Premier Mario Draghi told reporters 
Friday that he laid out his government’s view at a European Council 
meeting in Brussels a day earlier. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">WHAT’S HAPPENING IN EASTERN UKRAINE? </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">In
 Ukraine’s Donbas region, where fighting since 2014 between Ukrainian 
forces and Russian-backed rebels has killed some 14,000 people, the 
rebels announced in videos posted online Friday that they were ordering 
an “immediate evacuation” to Russia because of the unrest.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">But metadata embedded in the video files showed they had been created two days earlier. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">A
 group of international monitors in eastern Ukraine that is tasked with 
keeping the peace reported more than 500 explosions in the 24 hours 
ending Thursday midday. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">On
 Friday, a car exploded outside the main government building in Donetsk,
 but no casualties were reported, and a U.N. Refugee Agency convoy came 
under shelling.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The
 rebels accuse Ukraine of preparing to invade the region, which Kyiv 
denies. The unrest may be part of Moscow’s suspected playbook of 
portraying Ukraine as the aggressor, thereby giving Russia grounds to 
invade.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Putin 
sent his emergencies minister to the Rostov region bordering Ukraine to 
help organize the evacuation. He ordered the government to give 10,000 
rubles (about $130) to each evacuee. That’s equivalent to about half the
 average monthly salary in the area.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">WHAT’S NEW ABOUT THE CYBERATTACKS?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The U.S. and Britain are <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-technology-europe-russia-c1903a7aa40a32e97cffc1c5f4958aa0">blaming Russia for this week’s cyberattacks</a><!-- --> targeting Ukraine’s defense ministry and major banks.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Anne
 Neuberger, the White House’s chief cyber official, said the attacks 
this week were of “limited impact” since Ukrainian officials were able 
to quickly get their systems back up and running, but it is possible 
that the Russians were laying the groundwork for more destructive ones.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">She and the British Foreign Office linked Tuesday’s attacks to Russian military intelligence officers. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">WHAT’S GOING ON AT THE KREMLIN?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The
 Kremlin says Putin will watch drills involving Russia’s strategic 
nuclear forces from the situation room at the Russian Defense Ministry. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The
 Defense Ministry said Putin will personally oversee Saturday’s display 
of his country’s nuclear might. Notably, the planned exercise involves 
the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet. Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula 
after seizing it from Ukraine in 2014. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">WHAT FORCES DOES RUSSIA HAVE NEAR UKRAINE?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The
 new U.S. estimate of up to 190,000 includes the Russian-backed 
separatists inside Ukraine, the Russian National Guard and Russian 
troops in Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014.
 These forces were not counted in previous assessments of troops 
deployed near Ukraine’s borders and in neighboring Belarus.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">As
 further indication that the Russians are preparing for a potential 
invasion, a U.S. defense official said an estimated 40% to 50% of the 
ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have 
moved into attack positions nearer the border. The defense official 
spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military 
assessments.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The 
official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion
 tactical groups deployed in the border area had grown to as many as 
125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each battalion tactical group has 750 to 
1,000 soldiers.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">WHAT HAS NATO DONE?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Meanwhile, NATO is beefing up its eastern regions. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The
 U.S. has begun deploying 5,000 troops to Poland and Romania. The Biden 
administration announced Friday it has approved a $6 billion sale of 250
 Abrams battle tanks and related equipment to Poland. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Britain
 is sending hundreds of soldiers to Poland and offering more warships 
and planes. It also is doubling the number of personnel in Estonia and 
sending tanks and armored fighting vehicles. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Germany,
 Norway and the Netherlands are sending additional troops to Lithuania. 
The Dutch government also is sending to Ukraine 100 sniper rifles, 
combat helmets and body armor, two mine detection robots and 
weapon-detection radar systems.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">WHAT ARE THE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO PREVENT WAR?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Biden
 spoke by phone on Friday afternoon with a number of European leaders 
and the leaders of the European Union and NATO about the likelihood of 
Russian aggression, the White House said. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">French
 President Emmanuel Macron, who was on the call, planned to speak with 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday and with Putin on 
Sunday. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">U.S. 
Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken were 
attending the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany. Moscow sent 
no delegates there.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Harris indicated the alliance’s approach to the crisis would continue.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">“We
 remain, of course, open to and desirous of diplomacy, as it relates to 
the dialogue and the discussions we have had with Russia,” Harris said 
in Munich. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">“But 
we are also committed, if Russia takes aggressive action, to ensure 
there will be severe consequences in terms of the sanctions we have 
discussed,” she said at a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens 
Stoltenberg.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock expressed regret that Russian leaders declined to attend the Munich conference. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">“Particularly
 in the current, extremely threatening situation, it would have been 
important to also meet Russian representatives in Munich,” Baerbock 
said. Even tiny steps toward peace would be “better than a big step 
toward war,” she added.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">____</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">AP reporters around the United States and Europe contributed.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Follow AP’s coverage of the tensions between Russia and Ukraine at <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p></div></div></div><div class="Component-footer-0-2-1 -footer"><div class="fluid-wrapper"><div class="Component-grid-0-2-2"><nav class="Component-nav-0-2-3"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">AP NEWS</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-news">Top Stories</a></li><li><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/videos">Video</a></li><li><a href="mailto:support@apnews.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="https://apnews.com/accessibility-statement">Accessibility Statement</a></li><li><button class="optanon-show-settings">Cookie Settings</button></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-apps-0-2-4"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Download AP NEWS</div><div class="Component-downloadDescription-0-2-11">Connect with the definitive source for global and local news</div><div class="Component-list-0-2-13"></div></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-moreFromAp-0-2-5"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">More from AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/">ap.org</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://insights.ap.org/">AP Insights</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.ap.org/">AP Definitive Source Blog</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://apimagesblog.com/">AP Images Spotlight</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/explore/">AP Explore</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/books/">AP Books</a></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-followAp-0-2-6"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Follow AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-17"><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/AP" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-twitter"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/APNews" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-facebook"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AssociatedPress" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-youtube"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/associated-press" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-linkedin"></use></svg></a></li></ol></nav><div class="Component-divider-0-2-7 Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><div class="Component-legalStuff-0-2-8 Component-legalStuff-0-2-20"><nav class="Component-legalStuffNav-0-2-21"><div class="Component-title-0-2-24 Component-spaceBelow-0-2-27">The Associated Press</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-22"><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/about/">About</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/contact-us/">Contact</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://aphelp.ap.org/">Customer Support</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/careers/">Careers</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a href="https://apnews.com/termsofservice">Terms &amp;

Victory in the Club World Cup last month completed the set of major honors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The success has been funded by around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) of loans to the club that Abramovich said he didn't want repaid when putting the club up for sale last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHY SANCTION ABRAMOVICH?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich has used legal means to try to publicly distance himself from benefiting from an association with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The British government thinks otherwise, saying Abramovich has obtained “a financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the government of Russia,\" including tax breaks, the sale of shares at favorable rates, and contracts in the buildup to Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich “is or has been involved in destabilizing Ukraine” via Evraz, a steel manufacturing and mining company which he effectively controls and has potentially supplied the Russia military, the government said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His fortune was made in oil and aluminium following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2005, Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom paid $13 billion for the Sibneft oil company controlled by Abramovich. It allowed Putin’s Kremlin to recapture state influence in the lucrative energy industry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON CHELSEA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The sanctions could have immediately forced Chelsea to stop running as a business, and preventing its teams from completing their seasons. Instead, a special license has been issued to allow it to continue operating, subject to heavy restrictions.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Only fans already with tickets — mainly season ticket holders — can attend matches, shutting out away fans from games. The club's shop had to close on Thursday morning. Staff at the hotel built onto Stamford Bridge said they were under orders to no longer accept new reservations or sell food and drink.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Only 500,000 pounds ($657,000) can be spent on staging each match at Stamford Bridge, including on security and catering. A maximum of 20,000 pounds can be spent on travel to matches. Chelsea plays in France at Lille in the Champions League next week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Player recruitment is also prohibited under the terms of the government license that runs through May 31. There are players with contracts expiring at the end of the season in June and the sanctions create uncertainty over whether Cesar Azpilicueta, Toni Rudiger and Andreas Christensen could be offered new deals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>CAN CHELSEA STILL BE SOLD?\u003c/p>\u003cp>As calls grew in the British parliament for Abramovich to be sanctioned, Chelsea was put up for sale.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated,” Abramovich said. “The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>It gave the impression of being an entity that Abramovich would be involved with. The foundation could have benefited Russian victims, too.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chelsea sought potential bidders to register their interest by next week. But now the government has oversight of the process.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“While the current license does not permit the sale of the club at this time, the government is open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a new license to allow for a sale,” the government said. “Proceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"BorisJohnson","name":"Boris Johnson","canonicalName":"boris-johnson","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-sports","name":"Sports","canonicalName":"sports","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false},{"id":"Soccer","name":"Soccer","canonicalName":"soccer","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-EuropeanSports","name":"Sports - Europe","canonicalName":"sports-europe","isPr":false},{"id":"London","name":"London","canonicalName":"london","isPr":false},{"id":"PremierLeague","name":"Premier League","canonicalName":"premier-league","isPr":false},{"id":"RomanAbramovich","name":"Roman Abramovich","canonicalName":"roman-abramovich","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null}],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":"Russia-Ukraine","hubPeekTagName":"Russia-Ukraine war","hubPeekCanonicalName":"russia-ukraine","hubPeekIsPr":false,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"Column List","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":"Compressed","endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null}},"loadedAt":{"afs:Card:929358031793":1646939144358},"expiration":120000},"content":{"loading":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:e9e56b0091c4a2541609ae35661643c9":false},"error":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:e9e56b0091c4a2541609ae35661643c9":null},"data":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:e9e56b0091c4a2541609ae35661643c9":{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:e9e56b0091c4a2541609ae35661643c9","shortId":"e9e56b0091c4a2541609ae35661643c9","etag":null,"bylines":"By The Associated Press","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":{},"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":null,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>Spiking tensions in eastern Ukraine are heightening Western fears of a Russian invasion and a new war in Europe, with U.S. President Joe \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-joe-biden-europe-russia-moscow-c2e55b8b2b061b58e2b140d2a6dc1d57\">Biden saying he's “convinced” \u003c/a> that Russian President Vladimir Putin has made the decision to invade.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"Ukraine-Russia crisis: What to know as the tension grinds on","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"2e82a849002c4472b57cf6c80bfe2b1e","leadVideoId":"8e6c9a8bac634412bbfbc7e2169e1d0c","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/e9e56b0091c4a2541609ae35661643c9","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"b3fed6de49c240128eeecc564761d9dc","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>Ukrainian National guard soldiers guard a mobile checkpoint together with the Ukrainian Security Service agents and police officers during a joint operation in Kharkiv, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. 17, 2022.

Asked about the potential for a Russian invasion, Austin said, “I don’t believe it’s a bluff.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT SANCTIONS WOULD RUSSIA FACE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. has decided to hold off on at least one of the most crushing financial options available to punish Russia if it invades Ukraine, Deputy National Economic Council Director Daleep Singh told reporters at a White House briefing Friday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Booting Russia out of the SWIFT financial system that moves money around the world was one of the most damaging steps the U.S. could take against the Russian economy, but it is opposed by some European allies for the spillover damage it would cause to their economies as well.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Asked Friday if Americans and their European allies — many of them more exposed to any collateral damage from sanctions hitting Russia’s economy — were on the same page on specific financial penalties, Biden said he expected “slight\" differences.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Singh described sanctions against Russian financial institutions and state-owned enterprises, as well as U.S. export controls that would deny Russia advanced technology it seeks for its industry and military.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At a time of high oil and gas prices, the U.S. also did not intend to try to block Russian energy from reaching global markets, he said, but gave no details.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Italy, which is heavily reliant on Russian gas, has pushed for energy to be kept out of any sanctions. Italian Premier Mario Draghi told reporters Friday that he laid out his government's view at a European Council meeting in Brussels a day earlier. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT’S HAPPENING IN EASTERN UKRAINE? \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Ukraine's Donbas region, where fighting since 2014 between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed rebels has killed some 14,000 people, the rebels announced in videos posted online Friday that they were ordering an “immediate evacuation” to Russia because of the unrest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But metadata embedded in the video files showed they had been created two days earlier. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A group of international monitors in eastern Ukraine that is tasked with keeping the peace reported more than 500 explosions in the 24 hours ending Thursday midday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Friday, a car exploded outside the main government building in Donetsk, but no casualties were reported, and a U.N. Refugee Agency convoy came under shelling.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The rebels accuse Ukraine of preparing to invade the region, which Kyiv denies. The unrest may be part of Moscow’s suspected playbook of portraying Ukraine as the aggressor, thereby giving Russia grounds to invade.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Putin sent his emergencies minister to the Rostov region bordering Ukraine to help organize the evacuation. He ordered the government to give 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee. That’s equivalent to about half the average monthly salary in the area.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT'S NEW ABOUT THE CYBERATTACKS?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. and Britain are \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-technology-europe-russia-c1903a7aa40a32e97cffc1c5f4958aa0\">blaming Russia for this week's cyberattacks\u003c/a> targeting Ukraine’s defense ministry and major banks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Anne Neuberger, the White House’s chief cyber official, said the attacks this week were of “limited impact” since Ukrainian officials were able to quickly get their systems back up and running, but it is possible that the Russians were laying the groundwork for more destructive ones.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She and the British Foreign Office linked Tuesday's attacks to Russian military intelligence officers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT’S GOING ON AT THE KREMLIN?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Kremlin says Putin will watch drills involving Russia’s strategic nuclear forces from the situation room at the Russian Defense Ministry. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Defense Ministry said Putin will personally oversee Saturday's display of his country's nuclear might. Notably, the planned exercise involves the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet. Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula after seizing it from Ukraine in 2014. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT FORCES DOES RUSSIA HAVE NEAR UKRAINE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The new U.S. estimate of up to 190,000 includes the Russian-backed separatists inside Ukraine, the Russian National Guard and Russian troops in Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. These forces were not counted in previous assessments of troops deployed near Ukraine’s borders and in neighboring Belarus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As further indication that the Russians are preparing for a potential invasion, a U.S. defense official said an estimated 40% to 50% of the ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have moved into attack positions nearer the border. The defense official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion tactical groups deployed in the border area had grown to as many as 125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each battalion tactical group has 750 to 1,000 soldiers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT HAS NATO DONE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, NATO is beefing up its eastern regions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. has begun deploying 5,000 troops to Poland and Romania. The Biden administration announced Friday it has approved a $6 billion sale of 250 Abrams battle tanks and related equipment to Poland. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Britain is sending hundreds of soldiers to Poland and offering more warships and planes. It also is doubling the number of personnel in Estonia and sending tanks and armored fighting vehicles. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Germany, Norway and the Netherlands are sending additional troops to Lithuania. The Dutch government also is sending to Ukraine 100 sniper rifles, combat helmets and body armor, two mine detection robots and weapon-detection radar systems.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ARE THE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO PREVENT WAR?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden spoke by phone on Friday afternoon with a number of European leaders and the leaders of the European Union and NATO about the likelihood of Russian aggression, the White House said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>French President Emmanuel Macron, who was on the call, planned to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday and with Putin on Sunday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken were attending the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany. Moscow sent no delegates there.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Harris indicated the alliance's approach to the crisis would continue.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We remain, of course, open to and desirous of diplomacy, as it relates to the dialogue and the discussions we have had with Russia,\" Harris said in Munich. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\"But we are also committed, if Russia takes aggressive action, to ensure there will be severe consequences in terms of the sanctions we have discussed,” she said at a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.\u003c/p>\u003cp>German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock expressed regret that Russian leaders declined to attend the Munich conference. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Particularly in the current, extremely threatening situation, it would have been important to also meet Russian representatives in Munich,” Baerbock said. Even tiny steps toward peace would be “better than a big step toward war,” she added.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP reporters around the United States and Europe contributed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow AP's coverage of the tensions between Russia and Ukraine at \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\u003c/a>\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"reporterKeys":["afs:Reporter:762019223963"],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false,"canonicalUrl":"russia-ukraine-joe-biden-united-states-europe-vladimir-putin","urlUpdated":null}},"loadedAt":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:e9e56b0091c4a2541609ae35661643c9":1646939144165},"expiration":120000},"medium":{"loading":{},"error":{},"data":{"b3fed6de49c240128eeecc564761d9dc":{"id":"b3fed6de49c240128eeecc564761d9dc","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>Ukrainian National guard soldiers guard a mobile checkpoint together with the Ukrainian Security Service agents and police officers during a joint operation in Kharkiv, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. 17, 2022.
