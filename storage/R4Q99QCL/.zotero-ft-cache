Supplementary information
Supplementary Tables

This file contains Supplementary Tables S1 to S3 and supplementary references 23−27. Supplementary Table S1 shows carbon flux estimates for the boreal and temperate forest area; Supplementary Table S2 shows estimates of nitrogen input rates needed to sustain the carbon build up in biomass, woody debris and soil organic matter; Supplementary Table S3 shows carbon sequestration in temperate and boreal forests with different management history.
