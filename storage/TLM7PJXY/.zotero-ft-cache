MONITORING & INVENTORY TOOLS 
 
Forest resources can be inventoried and monitored using various techniques, ranging from simple assessments to more complex statistical sampling of attributes such as snag density, timber volume, and stream-side canopy. The sections below identify various monitoring protocols you can use on your forest, including links to field forms. 
WHAT TO MONITOR 
FOREST INVENTORY 
 
Purpose 
Determine baseline stand and timber information, comply with FSC® monitoring requirements (Indicator 8.2). 
 
Data 
Quantitative – statistical sample and permanent plots. 
 
Variables 
– Tree species, diameter, defect, height, and age 
– Sapling species and diameter 
– Shrub species and percent cover 
– Number of snag 
 
Forms 
Trees 
 
Saplings and Shrubs 
 
Inventory Program in Excel (to calculate trees per acre, etc.) 
FOREST STANDS 
 
Purpose 
Track important ecological and physical attributes through time. 
 
Data 
Qualitative – walk transects through the forest. 
 
Variables 
– Forest health and ecological hotspots 
– Wildlife 
– Trees and shrubs 
 
 
Form 
How to Measure Woody Biomass in Your Forest 
 
Woody Biomass Calculator   
 
  
ROADS 
 
Purpose 
Detect and track road deterioration, maintenance needs, or negative environmental impacts. 
 
Data 
Qualitative – traverse road segments 
 
Variables 
– Road issues and severity 
– Maintenance needs 
– Appropriateness of culvert size compared to stream 
– Passability of culverts on fish bearing streams 
 
Form 
Roads 
STREAMS & WETLANDS 
Purpose 
 
Track general stream conditions and detect any detrimental disturbance impacts. 
 
Data 
Qualitative – walk stream segments and around wetlands 
 
Variables 
– Channel & wetland characteristics 
– Water quality 
– Vegetation 
– Stream organisms 
– Wetland wildlife 
– Large woody debris 
 
Forms 
Streams 
 
Wetlands 
BIODIVERSITY 
 
 
Purpose 
Identify areas of high biological value; monitor impacts of conservation and/or harvest activities; comply with FSC monitoring requirements (Indicators 6.1, 9.4). 
 
Data 
Qualitative – forest site visit. 
 
Variables 
– Topography and site characteristics 
– Forest dynamics 
– Forest habitat 
– Tree types and sizes 
– Forest structure 
– Snags and down trees 
 
Forms 
West Cascades Douglas Fir and Mixed Conifer Stands 
 
Early Seral/Young Stands 
 
 
Oak/Douglas Fir and Oak/Pine Woodlands 
 
 
East Cascades Ponderosa Pine/Mixed Conifer Stands 
CARBON SEQUESTRATION 
 
Purpose 
Quantify forest carbon storage; enter voluntary and/or regulatory carbon offset markets 
 
Data 
Quantitative – inventory with permanent plots, and carbon calculator. 
 
Variables 
– Species, diameter, height of standing live trees 
– Diameter, height, and decay class of standing dead trees 
– Volume of harvested wood products 
 
Tool 
Carbon Calculator 
ADDITIONAL MONITORING & INVENTORY RESOURCES 
 
      Conducting a Forest Biodiversity Assessment – This NNRG guide describes the Forest Biodiversity Assessment monitoring tool and how to use it in the woods. The Forest Biodiversity Assessment is intended to be an easy-to-use tool for forest owners to observe and identify the components, structures and processes necessary to restore, increase, or sustain forest health. 
    Forest Inventory and Monitoring Guidelines – The goal of this NNRG guidebook is to provide a practical, simple inventory and monitoring system for landowners who own less than 2,500 acres. 
    How to Measure Woody Biomass in Your Forest – This NNRG guide provides landowners with a practical inventory system for estimating the volume of timber and woody biomass in their forest. In following these guidelines, landowners can more easily collect information to inform their forest management decisions.  
    Woody Biomass Calculator – This calculator tool by NNRG allows forest owners to convert basic tree measurements and forest data into estimates of timber and biomass volumes. 
    Monitoring Ecosystem Services  – Visit this NNRG webpage to find resources on monitoring ecosystem services.
