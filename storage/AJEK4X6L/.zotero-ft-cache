arising from : S. Luyssaert et al. Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07276 (2008)

Luyssaert et al. 1 reported that unmanaged, old-growth forests continue to sequester atmospheric carbon (C) at a rate of 2.4 ± 0.8 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 for stand ages exceeding 200 years. This claim was based on an analysis of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and other C flux data from temperate or boreal forest plots compiled from published studies and databases. Their conclusions and quantitative estimates are widely cited and essential in the debate on the role of forests in climate mitigation. Thus, it is important to discuss the validity of these estimates.

Their conclusion was surprising given that such forests were thought to be C neutral 2 . Using data from several different viewpoints (for example, global net land flux, soil C accumulation rate, N demand to sustain C accumulation) and a re-analysis of the data provided by Luyssaert et al. 1 , we find evidence that the forest NEP values reported in the paper are markedly overestimated. Our analysis suggests that NEP is only 1.6 ± 0.6 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 for forests more than 200 years old, or about one-third less than the value reported by Luyssaert et al. Moreover, comparisons of net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) suggest that some old unmanaged forests might serve as C sources. These inconsistencies bring into question the value of the NEP flux data given in Luyssaert et al. 1 and their conclusion that unmanaged old-growth forests are important C sinks.

Using the NEP estimate for old forests (2.4 ± 0.8 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 ) for all temperate and boreal forests (1.9 × 10 9  ha) 3 , the estimated C sink in these forests would be 4.6 ± 1.5 Pg C yr –1 . Although this simple upscaling ignores small C losses from fire, volatile emissions, harvest and leaching (Supplementary Table 1 ), it is likely to be a conservative estimate because younger forests have higher NEP (Fig. 1a ). Importantly, the combined estimate for temperate and boreal old-growth forests is almost twice the global net land C sink (2.6 Pg C yr –1 ) reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) based on other metrics 4 and almost twice the global forest C sink (2.4 Pg C yr –1 ) estimated from forest inventory data 3 . Given that tropical forests were recently concluded to be a minor C source of 0.4 Pg C yr –1 (ref. 5 ), we argue that the C sink and NEP estimates for old-growth forests by Luyssaert et al. 1 are too high and are not constrained by the global C budget.

The large variability may be an effect of differences in disturbance history (Supplementary Table 3 ). c , Observed NPP versus age. In each panel, the red dots show recently disturbed forests, brown dots show observations of managed forests and the green dots show observations of unmanaged forests; the thick lines show the mean within a moving window of 15 observations for each forest category colour-coded as for the observations and grey areas around these lines delineate 95% confidence intervals. The analysis is based on the same dataset 22 as used by Luyssaert et al. 1 .

Temperate and boreal forests on upland soils, from where most of the flux data were derived, contain 100−150 Mg C ha –1 down to a soil depth of 1 m (ref. 6 ). Luyssaert et al. 1 estimated a C sequestration rate of 1.3 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 in roots and soil organic matter, which implies that the soil organic C stock should increase 1% per year and roughly double over the next century. Given that it took over 100 centuries to reach the current level, the rate of soil C sequestration appears to be highly overestimated. Only forests on peat soils could have such high soil C sequestration rates 7 .

Carbon accumulation requires nitrogen (N) accumulation since C and N are closely linked in organic matter with characteristic tissue-specific C−N stoichiometries 8 . When the estimated C sequestration rates for biomass, coarse woody debris and soil are multiplied by their specific C-to-N ratios (Supplementary Table 2 ) it appears that 47 kg N ha –1  yr –1 is needed to sustain the NEP estimates of Luyssaert et al. 1 . Although an input of 50 kg N ha –1  yr –1 with N deposition was observed in smaller regions 9 , 10 , 11 , about 90% of the global land cover receives less than 10 kg N ha –1  yr –1 (ref. 12 ). Whereas young aggrading forests may acquire large amounts of N from the soil pool through mineralization of organic matter 13 (and respiration of soil C), old forests where soil organic matter is accumulating (as suggested by the data in Luyssaert et al. 1 ) need N from external sources. Deposition inputs can supply the N needed for net biomass C accretion (at high C-to-N ratios), but the accumulation of C in soil organic matter (at low C-to-N ratios) estimated by Luyssaert et al. 1 requires large N inputs (40 kg N ha –1  yr –1 ), either to be taken up by plants and recycled to the soil as litter or immobilized by the soil microbes during litter decomposition and transferred to relatively inactive soil organic matter through time. As such, the estimated soil C sequestration rates are likely to be unrealistic and highly overestimated.

The authors of Luyssaert et al. 1 do not discuss the management history of the forests even though the original NEP database includes a categorical variable for forest management history (recently disturbed, managed and unmanaged categories). We calculated the average NEP for different age and management history categories (Supplementary Table 3 ) and explored the original database in a similar way as did Luyssaert et al. 1 , but with a focus on management history of the forests (Fig. 1 ). We were unable to reproduce their main conclusion that forests more than 200 years old sequester, on average, 2.4 ± 0.8 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 . The twelve forests in the database with ages exceeding 200 years had an average NEP of 1.6 ± 0.6 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 and for the ten unmanaged forests the average NEP was only 1.3 ± 0.6 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 (Supplementary Table 3 ). Although the lower average NEP for forests with ages exceeding 200 years of 1.6 ± 0.6 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 fits better into the global C budget, it seems to be an overestimate from the perspective of C in soil. If we accept the partitioning of NEP into trees and woody debris suggested by Luyssaert et al. 1 , it implies that 0.4 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 should be sequestered in soil organic matter (doubling soil C in 300 years) and requires external inputs of about 20 kg N ha –1  yr –1 or about twice the available N input (Supplementary Table 2 ).

The NEP estimates for unmanaged forests are lower than for managed forests (on average half the value), but are partly separated on the age scale (Fig. 1a ). Managed forests (where interventions aim to increase wood production) had higher NPP than unmanaged and disturbed forests (Fig. 1c ). Ratios of Rh to NPP are clearly different for managed and unmanaged forests (Fig. 1b ). Managed forests have Rh:NPP <1, indicating that they are C sinks, whereas unmanaged forests have Rh:NPP >1 on average, indicating that they are C sources (following the interpretation of these ratios as explained by Luyssaert et al. 1 ). Thus, analysis of Rh:NPP ratios suggests that unmanaged forests should be expected to have negative NEP fluxes. This was, however, only the case for a few sites (Fig. 1a ) and the average for unmanaged forests across all ages was 1.3 ± 0.4 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 , indicating a net C sink (Supplementary Table 2 ). Because Rh and NPP are estimated independently of NEP, the inconsistency again indicates that NEP estimates are too high.

Most NEP data were from studies using eddy-covariance techniques to estimate the net C flux as a difference between photosynthesis and respiration fluxes. Eddy-covariance is a well established but complex technique performed in coordinated regional networks, which are expected to produce high-quality data. However, a major limitation of the eddy-covariance technique is the requirement for turbulent atmospheric conditions during measurement, which, together with equipment failures, produce data gaps typically 20–60% of the time in annual datasets, with the majority of the gaps occurring during night-time 14 . The data quality and filtering procedures, the methods used for gap filling, the flux partitioning methods and site inhomogeneity all contribute to uncertainty in NEP data 15 . A comparison of four different gap-filling methods on a time series from an old-growth forest in Canada 16 showed a methodological difference equivalent to 0.5 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 . In that forest, the choice of gap-filling method could change the forest from being C neutral to become a C sink. Differences between gap-filling methods can be from 0.3 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 up to 0.8 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 (ref. 14 ) and are obviously most important at low NEP such as in old and unmanaged forests.

During periods with low air turbulence, such as advection at night, the eddy-covariance method potentially leads to underestimation of ecosystem respiration at night 17 . A method comparison of eddy-covariance and biometric based NEP estimates revealed significantly higher NEP from eddy covariance than from biometric methods (1.7 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 in boreal forests ( n  = 6; P  < 0.02) and 1.0 Mg C ha –1  yr –1 in temperate forests ( n  = 22; P  < 0.003)) 18 . Although both methods are uncertain, the observed bias could explain the inconsistencies and overestimations of NEP as described above. However, recent NEP data to be used in future evaluations may have lower uncertainties and less bias owing to improvements to the eddy flux techniques since 2008 19 , 20 .

A contributing reason to the overestimation may be confusion about the management history of the included forests. Old-growth forest is an ambiguous term that some use for primary forest, but others interpret to mean merely forest with old trees 21 . In their abstract, Luyssaert et al. 1 indicate that they understand old-growth forest to be unmanaged, primary forests given that they scale up their NEP estimate to the area of primary forests in the Northern Hemisphere. When referring to the database, however, it appears that the authors used both managed and unmanaged old-growth forests in their analyses.

In conclusion, the NEP data used in the analysis of Luyssaert et al. 1 appear to contain overestimates and thus the quantitative estimates of C sequestration in old-growth forests are suspect. In particular, the high soil C sequestration rate suggested by Luyssaert et al. 1 is implausible. Unmanaged forests in the dataset had lower C sequestration rates than managed forests. Therefore, the role of old-growth forests (particularly unmanaged forests) in the global C budget should be revisited.
