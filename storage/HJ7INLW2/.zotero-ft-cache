Description 
We sampled trees grown with and without competing vegetation control in an 11-year-old Douglas-fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) plantation on a highly productive site in southwestern Washington to create diameter based allometric equations for estimating individual-tree bole, branch, foliar, and total aboveground biomass. We used these equations to estimate per-hectare aboveground biomass, nitrogen (N), and carbon (C) content, and compared these results to (1) estimates based on biomass equations published in other studies, and (2) estimates made using the mean-tree method rather than allometric equations. Component and total-tree biomass equations were not influenced by the presence of vegetation control, although per-hectare biomass, C, and N estimates were greater where vegetation control was applied. Our biomass estimates differed from estimates using previously published biomass equations by as much as 23 percent. When using the mean-tree biomass estimation approach, we found that incorporating a previously published biomass equation improved accuracy of the mean-tree diameter calculation.
