Historically, tree biomass at large scales has been estimated by applying dimensional analysis techniques and ﬁeld measurements such as diameter at breast height (dbh) in allometric regression equations. Equations often have been developed using differing methods and applied only to certain species or isolated areas. We previously had compiled and combined (in meta-analysis) available diameter-based allometric regression equations for estimating total aboveground and component dry-weight biomass for US trees. This had resulted in a set of 10 consistent, national-scale aboveground biomass regression equations for US species, as well as equations for predicting biomass of tree components as proportions of total aboveground biomass. In this update of our published equation database and reﬁnement of our model, we developed equations based on allometric scaling theory, using taxonomic groupings and wood speciﬁc gravity as surrogates for scaling parameters that we could not estimate. The new approach resulted in 35 theoretically based generalized equations (13 conifer, 18 hardwood, 4 woodland), compared with the previous empirically grouped 10. For trees from USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) plots, with forest types grouped into conifers and hardwoods, previous and updated equations produced nearly identical estimates that predicted 20 per cent higher biomass than FIA estimates. Differences were observed between previous and updated equation estimates when comparisons were made using individual FIA forest types.

Introduction
Tree biomass estimation has become critically important in recent years as the climate warms and estimates of fuel loads, biomass of forest products (including bioenergy products) and stored forest carbon ( 50 per cent of forest biomass) are needed. However, biomass estimation procedures historically have been speciesand site-speciﬁc, with a variety of different methods used. Our previous work (Jenkins et al., 2003) was the result of an attempt to produce standardized, consistent and well-documented tree biomass estimation equations on a national scale, through compilation and synthesis of equations published in the literature, for use in the forest sector (Heath et al., 2011)of the Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks (e.g. EPA, 2012). We had used a meta-analysis to develop 10 generalized species-group-speciﬁc equations for estimating aboveground biomass from only diameter measurements using regression and log-transformation; two accompanying hardwood and conifer component ratio equations were also developed. Basing equations on diameter and not on height allowed for the most ﬂexible usage. A companion publication (Jenkins et al., 2004) supplied users with the full database of equations. This work could best have been improved by a thoughtfully designed collection of new data for study and/or use in replacing the generalized prediction equations. Such a dataset,

however, is an extensive undertaking and has not been generated in the 10 years since the previous study, so another more exhaustive meta-analysis was conducted with an updated set of literature equations.
In this study, we updated the Jenkins et al. (2004) database and reﬁned our database and model. Instead of letting the statistical summary drive the ﬁnal number of equations as it had in the previous study, we employed a more theoretically based approach, with generalized equation development based on factors whose importance was suggested by allometric scaling theory: taxonomic groupings (genus or family) and wood speciﬁc gravity. These factors were used as surrogates for scaling parameters that could not be estimated without collecting new data. We anticipated that the updated database and reﬁned methodology would enable us to meet our objective of creating estimation equations for more species groupings and with enhanced predictive value.

will be described in detail. In brief, we compiled biomass estimation equations (based on measured data) from the literature, and using a meta-analysis, generated data for diameter-based published equations at intervals within the diameter ranges of the original equations – resulting in what we called ‘pseudodata’ following work of Pastor et al. (1984). This simply generated predicted values from equations (without any random component) to put all literature equations on a common basis, and is somewhat analogous to having original data from which to develop new generalized equations. We then ﬁt the pseudodata to produce generalized national-scale equations by using regression and log transformation.

The study presented here included the following steps, detailed below:

(1) The biomass equation literature was updated with equations published on May 2011.
(2) Deﬁnitions were established and author measurement differences resolved prior to incorporation of published equations into the database.
(3) Preliminary analyses and modiﬁcations were conducted, enabling some equations excluded from Jenkins et al. (2003) to be incorporated.
(4) Pseudodata were generated for each equation within the diameter range of that equation.
(5) Total aboveground and belowground dry biomass and root component biomass models were constructed from pseudodata.

Figure 1 Diameter conversion based on 205 trees measured in VA, NM, OR and WA, including (a) conifer species: 34 pine, 26 spruce, 20 Douglas-ﬁr, 17 hemlock, 15 cedar, and 12 ﬁr; (b) hardwood species: 17 aspen, 11 alder, 10 oak, 7 tulip poplar, 6 maple, 3 sycamore, 3 hickory, 3 locust, 2 ash, 2 birch and 9 other hardwoods; (c) woodland species: 6 pinyon and 2 juniper. Regression R2-statistic was 0.987 for logarithmic regression. (Contact corresponding author (D.C.C.) for further information).

Updated literature search
Our initial database included 2626 equations but this study brought the total to 3464 aboveground biomass and component equations for North American tree species from 206 source studies. Our literature search encompassed bibliographies of relevant papers and the literature was identiﬁed using the search engines Academic Search Premier, AGRICOLA, CAB Direct, Environmental Science Complete, Geobase, Web of Science and Google Scholar. We included published equations up to May 2011 developed for the US or Canada that estimated total dry biomass for individual trees and/or components thereof, based on diameter alone or on diameter and height. We omitted equations for palms, citrus, dry tropical and nonnative tree species.

Diameter measurements
Generally, diameter measurements at root collar (drc; generally near groundline but above root collar swell) are used only for woodland species, but some of the smaller trees of species for which a diameter at breast height (dbh; 1.37 m above groundline) measurement typically is used were also measured at drc. We measured 205 single-stem conifer and hardwood trees that had few to no branches between drc and dbh to obtain a diameter conversion for these small trees that was also useful for comparing biomass of all species at a common measurement point (Figure 1). Although this should be studied in more detail, our equation seemed to be reasonable for converting the few hardwood and small conifer drc measurements to dbh.

Deﬁnitions
Biomass
Total aboveground biomass was deﬁned as all material aboveground, which was fairly consistent among all studies except for some stump exclusion. Biomass components in the database were driven by author deﬁnitions; these included 58 unique categories that we collapsed into total above- and belowground biomass, and/or into the 6 categories of stem wood, stem bark, branches, foliage, coarse roots and ﬁne roots. Component equations were used to calculate total aboveground biomass by summation when no total aboveground biomass equation was available. Breakpoints between coarse and ﬁne roots varied among authors, but equations were so limited that we used all available studies and author breakpoints.
General tree groups

Speciﬁc gravity
Unless otherwise stated, ‘speciﬁc gravity’ refers to basic speciﬁc gravity of wood (on green volume to dry-weight basis) (Williamson and Wiemann, 2010). Speciﬁc gravity of wood was included in the database for each species for use in classifying species and grouping as described below. Speciﬁc gravity values are unitless and did not include any measure of variability. We used values from the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) (FIA, 2010), which for almost all US tree species were based on Miles and Smith (2009). We used our values from previous work for some woodland species (Cercocarpus ¼ 0.81 (Chojnacky, 1984); Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) ¼ 0.54, oneseed juniper (J. monosperma) ¼ 0.58, pinyon pine ¼ 0.51 (Pinus edulis) (Chojnacky and Moisen, 1993)). Balsam ﬁr (Abies balsamea) speciﬁc gravity (0.33) was used for Fraser ﬁr (A. fraseri) instead of the genus average as suggested by Miles and Smith (2009), speciﬁc gravity for paloverde (Cercidium microphyllum) was set at 0.60 (National Academy of Sciences, 1980), and hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) was set at 0.34 (Hamilton and Wendel, 1967; Goyal et al., 1999).

Tree groups that we refer to as hardwood, conifer and woodland correspond to trees that are angiosperms, gymnosperms and a mixed group of frequently multistemmed hardwood and conifer species generally measured near groundline, respectively. Species which comprise each of these groups are listed in the tables.

Stumps
Unless the author speciﬁed otherwise, we assumed stumps (5– 30 cm, generally 15 cm above ground level) were included in aboveground biomass. Stump pseudodata were calculated for those equations where a stump

height was speciﬁed by the author and where stump biomass was explicitly excluded from aboveground biomass and/or included with coarse root biomass. We used the dbh-to-drc equation in Figure 1 (or drc directly if provided) and the author-reported stump height to approximate stump volume as a cylinder with drc as the diameter, then converted volumeto-biomass using speciﬁc gravity. Where the author excluded stump biomass from aboveground biomass, it was added to the total, and where stump biomass was included with coarse root biomass, it was subtracted from root. Stump correction affected only 25 per cent of ﬁnal summarized biomass data and the median correction was ,2.5 per cent increase in aboveground biomass. Large corrections .25 per cent occurred for ,1 per cent of data and these were generally for trees ,6-cm dbh.
Tree diameter ranges
Tree diameter ranges for which the original equations were developed were critical for our analyses so pseudodata were not generated outside ranges of original study trees. This information was generally available but in some cases was inferred from data graphs, text descriptions of sample sites or even auxiliary data as described below.
Preliminary analyses and equation modiﬁcations
The equations from the literature were generally recorded in our database in the exact mathematical form given by the author. However, when using this approach in our previous work (Jenkins et al., 2003) with 2626 literature equations for total or component biomass (not all usable), we were able to assemble only 318 aboveground biomass estimation equations for meta-analyses, which represented 100 species or species groups. We wanted to ﬁll gaps in the previous study’s pseudodata, maximize the number of usable equations, and broaden the resultant applicability of the generalized estimation equations produced from the meta-analysis. Therefore, we combined studies or conducted preliminary analyses to modify some equations to ﬁt our format for generating pseudodata. Of the 206 biomass studies (Table 1) compiled in this update that were not included in our previous study, equations from 55 were modiﬁed to ﬁt criteria for estimating aboveground biomass. Details of these modiﬁcations are supplied in the Appendix. Pseudodata generated from these modiﬁed equations were later compared with those generated from unmodiﬁed equations to check for possible bias, as described below.
Pseudodata generation
We needed an estimate of aboveground biomass predicted from diameter that could be obtained from either a single equation or from the sum of component equations. After inclusion of modiﬁed equations, the ﬁnal database for biomass meta-analyses included 2928 total or component equations for 129 species, from which we could assemble equations for 675 estimates of aboveground biomass and 82 estimates of belowground biomass. For each of the 2928 biomass equations, biomass values (pseudodata) were generated for diameters at equally spaced, 5-cm intervals within the diameter (dbh or drc) range of the trees used to develop the original equation. However, several modiﬁcations were made to this data generation rule. Minimum diameter (dbh or drc) was set at 3 cm because only a few studies included trees with a minimum diameter of ,3 cm, whereas in about half the studies this parameter was ≥3 cm. For small diameter ranges, the ‘5-cm interval rule’ was modiﬁed to include a minimum number of pseudodata values. Four pseudodata values were generated for diameter ranges between 10 and 14 cm; 3 between 5 and 9 cm; and 2 between 3 and 5 cm. The number of pseudodata values for very large diameter ranges was restricted so as to not exceed the sample size of the original study; this increased diameter intervals in 8 studies generally to between 6 and 8 cm, with extremes of 11 and 15 cm. Of the total 21 521

pseudodata values generated in the study, the median number of pseudodata values generated per equation was 6.
After applying stump adjustments (as described above), pseudodata from each study’s equations were used directly in regression metaanalyses, except for studies where biomass equations were reported for individual treatments within a designed experiment. For 8 such studies, pseudodata were averaged for each diameter across all treatments – essentially generating only one equation per species with these pseudodata. In addition to aboveground biomass equations, 34 per cent of the studies reported biomass component equations that also added to total aboveground biomass; for these studies we selected the estimate based on the aboveground biomass equation.
After summarizing all the pseudodata (combining components, averaging treatments, selecting best estimates and adjusting for stumps), we had 5031 pseudodata values for modeling aboveground biomass (as function of dbh) for 129 species or species groups – with 48 and 28 per cent of the pseudodata coming from equations developed for the eastern and western US, respectively, and 24 per cent from equations developed for Canada.
Although our database is structured to allow interested researchers to pursue modeling of biomass component equations, in this study we generated pseudodata only for root components, which were modeled as a ratio of aboveground biomass. A ratio model was used because it seemed to be the most consistent way to extrapolate our limited root data to many species. However, of the 82 root equations, 17 (from 10 studies) needed accompanying aboveground biomass pseudodata because only roots were measured (see Table 1). This was obtained by assembling aboveground biomass pseudodata from similar species in the other pseudodata, with stump corrections conducted as described above in deﬁnitions. A total of 700 pseudodata values for 39 species or species groups were generated for root component ratios.
Construction of above- and belowground biomass models
In our previous work (Jenkins et al., 2003), the pseudodata essentially drove classiﬁcation of species into groups for regression modeling. But the ability to synthesize more than 300 equations into only 10 generalized equations suggested an underlying principle was at work, such as allometric scaling theory (Chojnacky, 2002). This generalized theory (see, e.g. West et al., 1997, 1999a, 1999b, 2009; Enquist et al., 1998, 1999, 2009) uses fractal dimensions of tree architecture and physics of ﬂuid transport up a tree to produce a generalized aboveground biomass model; the biomass equation utilizes a diameter-to-mass scaling relationship, where primary predictor variables are diameter and mean speciﬁc gravity of the entire tree. Although we make no attempt to directly apply allometric scaling theory, we do include the importance of speciﬁc gravity in our formulation. Chave et al. (2005) also support the importance of speciﬁc gravity for aboveground biomass estimation.
Although speciﬁc gravity of wood is likely correlated with the mean speciﬁc gravity of entire tree (a parameter that is seldom measured), it did not make sense to directly use it in our modeling because differences in speciﬁc gravity as reported by various authors for stem sapwood, heartwood, bark, branches and/or tree sizes within an individual species often range from 0.05 to more than 0.10 units (Wahlgren and Fassnacht, 1959; Carpenter, 1983; Clark and Schroeder, 1986; Clark et al., 1986a). Instead the relative similarity of the speciﬁc gravity of tree species within genera and/or families led us to use taxonomy as an initial proxy for mean speciﬁc gravity of entire tree – but we also allowed for further splits into speciﬁc gravity classes when speciﬁc gravity was highly dissimilar within these taxonomic groupings. In this way we were able to utilize the principles of allometric scaling theory without having to precisely measure the mean speciﬁc gravity of entire tree. For example, Salicaceae (aspen/willow/poplar) species tend to be low in speciﬁc gravity whereas Fagaceae (oak/beech) tend to be high. For the purposes of our modeling, we used the words ‘taxon’ or ‘taxa’ to refer

to a classiﬁcation based on family or genus, although these were sometimes further split into groups based on speciﬁc gravity.
Classifying pseudodata into taxa
Classiﬁcation into taxa and modeling of pseudodata were conducted concurrently because ﬁnal grouping was based largely on regression results and diagnostics for ﬁnding the best data ﬁt. However, our classiﬁcation strategy is outlined here, with detailed modeling results discussed below. We began with a genus-based classiﬁcation for conifer species, but for hardwoods, because there were so many genera, family was the starting point. Family was also used for initial classiﬁcation of woodland species. Further separation was conducted based on speciﬁc gravity, sample size (i.e. quantity of pseudodata, numbers of underlying equations and diameter range of equations), and coarse geography (eastern vs western North America). Speciﬁc gravity was included in our database as previously described; for conifer species it ranged from 0.29 to 0.54 (most 0.35 –0.45), for hardwoods from 0.31 to 0.66 (most 0.40 –0.60), and for woodland species from 0.41 –0.81. Final classiﬁcation into taxa was an iterative process based on observing biomass-to-dbh patterns (from graphs), testing regression coefﬁcients (using robust logarithmic regression described in more detail below), and observing regression residual patterns. In the end, 35 taxa – 13 conifers, 18 hardwood, and 4 woodland – were identiﬁed for one or more unique parameters in predicting biomass.
Conifer species were initially separated into 6 genera and the Cupressaceae family (Table 2). Further separation was made for the Cupressaceae family and for the genera Abies, Picea, Pinus and Tsuga based on geography and speciﬁc gravity. (Only two US coniferous genera – Taxus and Torreya – were missing from our taxa classiﬁcation scheme; we suggest using Douglas-ﬁr or hemlock genera equations for these.)

Aceraceae, Betulaceae, Fagaceae and Salicaceae comprised nearly three-fourths of the hardwood species (Table 3), so these families were initially separated out and considered for further separation based on speciﬁc gravity. Fabaceae and Juglandaceae had speciﬁc gravities .0.60 and were combined, as were Hippocastanaceae and Tilaceae with speciﬁc gravities near 0.30. The remaining 9 families, which included mostly species with speciﬁc gravity 0.45 –0.55, were initially grouped to construct a general hardwood taxon for those families having few published biomass equations; however, 3 warranted separation, leaving 6 families for the general taxon.
Pseudodata for woodland species separated naturally into familybased taxa including Cupressaceae (junipers), Pinaceae (pinyon), Fagaceae (evergreen oaks), Fabaceae (mesquite) and Rosaceae (mountain mahogany); but Fabaceae and Rosaceae were combined based on very high speciﬁc gravities and small numbers of pseudodata (studies) for each family (Table 4). (For woodland species not included in our pseudodata – hardwoods measured at drc (e.g. Acer glabrum, Arbutus xalapensis, Robinia neomexicana) – we suggest drc be converted to dbh (Figure 1) to estimate biomass from the appropriate hardwood taxa equations).
Regression modeling of aboveground biomass
For regression modeling conducted simultaneously with the classiﬁcation based on taxa as described above, we selected the two-parameter logarithmic regression model. It was selected because it rescales unequal variation in the biomass-to-diameter relationship into equal variation after logarithmic transformation [ln(biomass) ¼ b0 + b1 ln(diameter), where diameter ¼ dbh for conifer/hardwood species and drc for woodland species]. Also, this logarithmic model was the basis for most of the equations from which our pseudodata were generated. Regression modeling was conducted with Proc RobustReg (#SAS Institute Inc., 2011), which is a robust regression

strategy that compromises between excluding outlying pseudodata entirely and treating them all equally as in Ordinary Least Squares regression. We used the M-estimation option (Maximum likelihood-like) which minimizes a weighted objective function – in this case, the bisquare weight, where all nonzero residuals were down-weighted (with weight between 1 and 0) in proportion to their distance from zero. This was particularly useful because our equation-generated observations (pseudodata) sometimes resulted in lines of points in divergent directions from the majority of other pseudodata: the weights captured the essence of these divergent equations (which we had no reason to exclude) and at the same time proportionately discounted outlying points.
Model ﬁtting was conducted repeatedly, adjusting variable inclusions with each iteration to settle on taxa groupings (as described above), select speciﬁc gravity groups, and improve ﬁt. Six factors were considered in ﬁnal model selection: (1) statistical signiﬁcance of model parameters, (2) favorable regression residual patterns, (3) avoidance of model extrapolation beyond data range, (4) Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for robust regression, (5) sample size (numbers of equations as well as pseudodata number) and (6) geographic distribution of species (such as eastern or western North America). Nonsigniﬁcant parameters were not included in models but marginally signiﬁcant parameters (P-values between 0.02 and 0.05) that would have further split taxa were sometimes ignored if pseudodata seemed to be too limited based on sample size considerations. All signiﬁcance testing was based on a x2-statistic and signiﬁcance level was set at 0.05 (for details on statistics see Proc RobustReg (# SAS Institute Inc., 2011)).
We also tested, within the robust regression (using binary (0,1-indicator) variables), pseudodata from the 55 modiﬁed equations (described in the ‘Preliminary analyses and equation modiﬁcations’ section) against pseudodata generated directly from published equations. These tests were conducted within the range of dbh overlap for the two equation types; generally there were no signiﬁcant differences except for Pseudotsuga which was highly signiﬁcant (Prob x2 , 0.001). Even so, this did not seem sufﬁcient cause to discard the pseudodata from ‘modiﬁed equations’ for Pseudotsuga because these data were only 10 per cent lower (from graph not shown) than pseudodata from ‘unmodiﬁed equations’ and there was no way of knowing which equations – ’modiﬁed’ or ‘unmodiﬁed’ – were more accurate. Therefore, all pseudodata – whether from modiﬁed or unmodiﬁed equations – were used in ﬁnal equation ﬁtting.
Although our biomass modeling was based on logarithmic transformation of variables, we did not include a correction (Baskerville, 1972) for underestimation. First, extending use of Baskerville’s correction to pseudodata (generated from equations) seemed to be unwise without some justiﬁcation. Second, correction procedures may in fact introduce their own bias (for further information, see Jenkins et al. (2003) and Flewelling and Pienaar (1981)). The extensive research needed to determine if and how correction factors could be applied for this type of modeling was beyond the scope of our study.
Results
Aboveground biomass
Conifers
Regression analyses resulted in equations for 13 conifer taxa (Table 5). Modeling was done within the genus or family (e.g. the Cupressaceae).
The main advantage of splits within genera was better regression ﬁt of pseudodata, often for small eastern-species trees. For Abies, Picea and Tsuga, speciﬁc gravity differences between eastern and western species nicely coincided with signiﬁcant parameters, except for western Abies lasiocarpa which better ﬁt with eastern Abies species. Larix included eastern and western species but

similar speciﬁc gravities and few pseudodata patterns precluded separation. The large Pinus genus was difﬁcult to model because it encompassed North America, included considerable pseudodata variation, and differed little in speciﬁc gravity from east to west (e.g. ponderosa pine pseudodata spanned the entire range of variation for all pines). Southern pine species (Pinus subsection Australes) with speciﬁc gravity ≥0.45 were an exception, and were separated from the rest.
Modeling the Cupressaceae family was more challenging. Our ﬁrst inclination was to subset the well-represented Thuja genera and further separate eastern and western species based on speciﬁc gravity, as all showed signiﬁcant test results, but this left too few pseudodata to model the rest –particularly for small trees. However, a three-tier speciﬁc-gravity-based compromise was found where the lowest speciﬁc gravity (,0.30) Thuja occidentalis was separated from the midrange speciﬁc gravity (0.30 –0.39) Thuja placata and other western Cupressaceae, and those from the highest speciﬁc gravity (≥0.40) Cupressaceae.
Comparison of prediction equations for the 13 conifer taxa illustrates the importance of speciﬁc gravity in the biomass-to-diameter relationship (Figure 2). High-speciﬁc-gravity southern pines (Pinus ≥ 0.45) and Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga) show the most aboveground biomass for given diameter, low-speciﬁc-gravity Cupressaceae show the least, and although midrange trends are less clear, generally higher speciﬁc gravity is associated with more biomass for a given dbh.
Hardwoods
Eighteen taxa equations resulted from regression analyses of hardwood species (Table 5). Of the four families with the most pseudodata, Aceraceae split nicely at speciﬁc gravity thresholds corresponding to hard (A. saccharum) and soft maple (other Acer species) and higher speciﬁc gravity aspen (and a few other higher speciﬁc gravity species) split from lower speciﬁc gravity balsam poplar in the Salicaceae. Betulaceae and Fagaceae were more troublesome because they included so many species. Betulaceae was separated into Alnus spp. and three more classes based on speciﬁc gravity. Fagaceae pseudodata included many species of similar speciﬁc gravity that could only be statistically separated based on deciduous or evergreen species.
As previously mentioned, Fabaceae and Juglandaceae were combined, as were Hippocastanaceae and Tiliaceae, to represent the extreme high and low speciﬁc gravities for hardwood species. In order to better design for species in Fabaceae/Juglandaceae that were not included in our study (e.g. walnut (Juglans), butternut (Juglans cinerea), Kentucky coffeetree (Gymnocladus dioicus), yellowwood (Cladrastis kentukea)), this group was further separated into Carya and other. Carya showed particularly high biomass (for a given dbh), which we did not wish to presume applied to species not represented in our data. A check against Wang’s (2006) walnut (Juglans mandshurica) equation from China showed a better match with the ‘other’ equation than the Carya equation, supporting our concern.
The rest of the hardwood families were initially grouped together, but Hamamelidaceae, Magnoliaceae and Oleaceae families were separated based on sufﬁcient pseudodata that tested different from the rest and from each other; and Oleaceae was further separated based on speciﬁc gravity. Although some of these separations did not result in large prediction differences

*Where spg is speciﬁc gravity of wood of on green volume to dry-weight basis. 1Table totals 676 equations because blue oak equation was used for both woodland and hardwood. 2As discussed in the text, woodland Cupressaceae (mostly juniper) equations seemed to predict low, possibly due to inﬂuence from early juniper diameter
measurements. Another juniper equation ﬁtted by adding pseudodata generated from unpublished studies (where drc was measured by current FIA definition) to those already utilized predicted 10–36% higher, depending on diameter [ln(biomass) ¼ 22.7190 + 2.2598 ln(drc)]. The corresponding author

among the resulting equations, they reduced lack-of-ﬁt patterns apparent in residual graphs when modeled separately. This left the six remaining families – Cornaceae, Ericaceae, Lauraceae, Platanaceae, Rosaceae and Ulmaceae – as a mixed hardwood group

covering speciﬁc gravity from 0.45 to 0.65. US hardwood families (excluding nonnative species) not included in our study (Aquifoliaceae, Ebenaceae, Lauraceae, Moraceae, Styracaceae and Theaceae) can probably be included in the mixed hardwood group or

Figure 2 Conifer aboveground biomass predicted from 13 taxa-scale equations that include all conifer genera in the US except those in the Taxaceae family (which can be approximated by Pseudotsuga). Some taxa are split according to speciﬁc gravity of wood (spg). Median speciﬁc gravity is also calculated for respective taxa. Legend lists taxa in order of curves at 50-cm dbh. Model is ln(biomass) ¼ b0 + b1 ln(dbh).

Figure 4 Woodland aboveground biomass predicted from four taxa-scale equations that include all woodland families in the US except Aceraceae, Boraginaceae, Ericaceae and Rhamnaceae (for which we suggest using the appropriate hardwood equation and diameter conversion). Median speciﬁc gravity (spg) is also calculated for respective taxa. Legend lists taxa in order of curves at 50-cm drc. Model is ln(biomass) ¼ b0 + b1 ln(drc).

Figure 3 Hardwood aboveground biomass predicted from 18 taxa-scale equations that encompass almost all US hardwood families. Some taxa are split according to speciﬁc gravity of wood (spg). The ‘6 hardwood families’ (mixed hardwoods) include Cornaceae, Ericaceae, Lauraceae, Platanaceae, Rosaceae, and Ulmacea with speciﬁc gravity from 0.45 to 0.65. (This equation could also be used for families not included in our study: Aquifoliaceae, Ebenaceae, Lauraceae, Moraceae, Styracaceae, and Theaceae.) Median speciﬁc gravity is also calculated for respective taxa. Legend lists taxa in order of curves at 50-cm dbh. Model is ln(biomass) ¼ b0 + b1 ln(dbh).
with a more appropriate family if the speciﬁc gravity of the species in question is very high or very low.
For a given dbh, the resulting hardwood prediction equations generally estimated greater biomass for those taxa with higher speciﬁc gravity and lower biomass for those with lower speciﬁc gravity, but again this trend was less apparent for taxa that have midrange speciﬁc gravity values (Figure 3).
Woodland species
Biomass studies for woodland species were so limited that we grouped them as families and modeled them without further separation, except that we grouped Fabaceae and Rosaceae together

because of small sample sizes and similar speciﬁc gravity (Table 5). Although pseudodata for these two families did show wide variation, we chose to average the variation in a robust regression rather than use the otherwise minimal pseudodata to model the two extremes. The four woodland prediction equations (Figure 4) did not show a logical speciﬁc gravity trend and the equation for Cupressaceae (mostly juniper) seemed to predict low. Further examination of these old studies used to generate pseudodata raised concern that their juniper drc deﬁnitions may have led to larger drc measurements (and thus smaller biomass estimates) than those for other woodland species; FIA developed a drc deﬁnition beginning in the 1980s designed to address this issue. Overall the woodland biomass equations – particularly juniper – probably best show the need for new, carefully measured data.
Goodness of ﬁt
Goodness-of-ﬁt for the biomass equations showed R2-statistics (see SAS, 2011 on Proc Robust for calculation details) between 0.75 and 0.91 (Table 5). Another graphical goodness-of-ﬁt assessment was conducted by examining regression residuals for each taxon that were computed using robust regression weights and averaged within 10-cm diameter classes. Results showed residuals to be within +10 per cent of predicted value for many conifers; exceptions within +20 per cent included Abies, Larix, Picea and Cupressaceae taxa. For large-diameter predictions for Pinus, Pseudotsuga and Tsuga larger variations up to +25– 40 per cent were observed; most of these were positive residuals – indicating underprediction. Mean residuals for hardwood taxa showed variation within +10 –20 per cent of predicted values – and for some taxa all within +10 per cent. Except for Pinaceae (within +10 per cent), woodland residuals had much larger ranges, with +30, +40 and even+70 per cent for Cupressaceae, Fagaceae and Fabaceae/Rosaceae, respectively. The Fabaceae/Rosaceae extreme was probably due to combining diverse families, as well as the very limited pseudodata.

Belowground biomass
Belowground biomass was modeled as the ratio of root component biomass to total aboveground biomass; ﬁne and coarse roots were treated separately. The breakpoint between coarse and ﬁne roots in published equations ranged from 2 to 10 mm diameter, with 5 or 10 mm most common. There were not enough species represented in our pseudodata to consider taxa separation for roots, and even hardwood and conifer separation was statistically nonsigniﬁcant. Therefore, one equation each for ﬁne and coarse roots was ﬁt from pseudodata by using robust regression (Table 6). Even though equations are presented, predictions are basically root-to-aboveground biomass ratios of 22 and 1 per cent for respective coarse and ﬁne roots. Root equations can be used for woodland species by ﬁrst converting drc to dbh (Figure 1).
Discussion
Our results provide a framework for selecting an aboveground biomass equation for every conifer, hardwood and woodland tree species in the US (except palm, citrus, dry tropical and other nonnative species) according to a taxa classiﬁcation. The taxa framework was based in part on allometric scaling theory, where tree species with the densest wood (greatest speciﬁc gravity) were predicted to have more biomass for a given diameter, and species with the least dense wood predicted to have less biomass.
The biomass estimates for all US trees species compiled by the FIA program are the only ones available for comparison with predictions from these equations. FIA generates biomass estimates with a biomass expansion factor approach called the component ratio method (CRM) (Woodall et al., 2011; Heath et al., 2009); cubic volume estimates are converted to biomass through use of constant wood and bark speciﬁc gravity values and auxiliary information for branches, bark and stumps (Miles and Smith, 2009), and any other biomass added to the biomass of the merchantable stem is based on Jenkins et al. (2003) methods.
We used FIA (2010) plot data with our taxa-scale equations, as well as the Jenkins et al. (2003) equations, and compared results with FIA biomass estimates for the same trees. This was done by selecting from the FIA database only live noncull trees .2.5 cm (by using FIA coding statuscd ¼ 1, treeclcd ¼ 2 for diahtcd ¼ 1 and treeclcd ¼ (2 or 3) for diahtcd ¼ 2; as described in Woudenberg et al. (2010)). About 2.3 million trees were selected from 119 000 plots. We summed biomass within the conditions established in FIA plots by using appropriate weights [see variables micrprop_ unadj, subpprop_unadj, and macrprop_unadj in Woudenberg et al. (2010)]. Per-hectare plot estimates were then averaged by FIA forest type group (Woudenberg et al., 2010, Appendix D). Several groups were combined due either to small sample size or similar per-hectare biomass values and nonstocked plots were excluded.
Comparison of all forest types (for trees measured at dbh) combined into conifer and hardwood groups (based on ﬁrst species of type name) showed no difference between Jenkins et al. (2003) and our taxa-scale equations – both equations predicted 93 and 64 Mg ha21 for conifers and hardwoods, respectively. This was not surprising because use of much of the same data and same modeling methodology should result in common results when summed over species. However, the species separation into

groups that was the main difference between the Jenkins et al. (2003) equations and those from this study produced marked differences among individual forest type groups for the two sets of equations, as discussed below. The FIA biomass estimates were
20 per cent less than those from the Jenkins et al. (2003) and our new equations, at 78 and 53 Mg ha21 for conifers and hardwoods, respectively (see Chojnacky (2012) for more details of comparison of new equations to FIA estimates).
Equations from this study and Jenkins et al. (2003) equations predicted 27 and 9 Mg ha21, respectively, for all woodland combined (trees measured at drc; FIA forest types pinyon/juniper and woodland hardwoods). This difference was attributed to addition of much more pseudodata for the new equations and a change in methodology – the Jenkins et al. (2003) equations were modeled at dbh based on a drc-to-dbh conversion that was probably not the best ﬁt for the intended use. Because the FIAwoodland estimates were based in part on the Jenkins et al. (2003) equations, they also estimated much lower biomass (15 Mg ha21) than the new equations (27 Mg ha21). In general, we suggest new woodland biomass data be collected to resolve estimation discrepancies but in the interim recommend our new equations based on the most thorough meta-analysis of published data to date.
For a more detailed examination of the conifer and hardwood equation comparisons to the FIA data, we looked at estimates at the forest type group scale. The pattern for conifer types showed equation differences from FIA ranging from 215 to 80 per cent (Figure 5); the maximum difference for hardwood types was 38 per cent (Figure 6), the smaller differences likely resulting from the higher species diversity within hardwood forest types being averaged among equations. We expected FIA estimates to be lower because FIA excluded foliage, but the magnitude of the differences we found suggested more than just a foliage discrepancy between the equation sets. FIA’s volume-to-biomass conversion may underestimate: Zhou et al. (2011) demonstrated for green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) and eastern redcedar (J. virginiana) that volume-to-biomass conversion (using speciﬁc gravity similar to FIA’s CRM method) consistently and signiﬁcantly underestimates biomass from 6.3 to 16.6 per cent. Alternatively, use of pseudodata as in this study may not produce accurate biomass estimates. New biomass data are needed to uncover the reason(s) for these differences (Figures 5 and 6).
Conclusions and recommendations
Updating the Jenkins et al. (2004)database with more recent equations from the literature, conducting preliminary analyses and modiﬁcations for previously excluded literature equations (some of which addressed data gaps), and use of a theoretically based approach did, as anticipated, result in generalized biomass estimation equations for more species groupings. The previous (Jenkins et al., 2003) approach produced 10 aboveground biomass equations. Our current work generated 35 biomass equations: 13 for conifers, 18 for hardwoods and 4 for woodland species.
There was little total difference between estimates from the equations in Jenkins et al. (2003) and those from the equations in this study for forest types combined into conifer and hardwood groups, which reﬂects different species groupings of much of the same data. However, there are some individual type differences, especially in the coniferous forest type groups of western pines

1This low R2-statistic indicates that the coarse root estimation is little more than a mean because the dbh term has very little effect. It is listed this way instead of as a mean to be consistent with other equations in the table and because this format is clearer for users such as computer programmers.

(western pines/juniper/other spp.), spruce/ﬁr (eastern spruce/ﬁr and western spruce/ﬁr/hemlock), Douglas-ﬁr, loblolly/shortleaf pine and longleaf/slash pine (Figure 5); and in the hardwood types of aspen/birch, western oak and oak/pine (Figure 6). Although we consider the equations generated through the use of speciﬁc gravity and taxonomy in this study to be more soundly based than the empirical pseudodata groupings in Jenkins et al. (2003), a user’s purpose may affect their preference as to which to use. If the user is primarily interested in total forest carbon, for hardwoods and conifers either set of equations could be used. We recommend the new equations for more detailed studies looking at species differences, and for woodland species.
We used allometric scaling theory as a theoretical basis for deriving consistent aboveground and belowground biomass estimation models through a meta-analysis approach. This theory suggests a tantalizingly simple model that would require only dbh and some proxy for mean speciﬁc gravity of entire tree as input variables, a concept supported by the clear importance of speciﬁc gravity in the biomass-to-diameter relationships modeled in this study. However, even if future studies prove this

simple model inadequate, more careful study of whole-tree and within-tree variation in speciﬁc gravity – for a variety of species, diverse growth forms and speciﬁc gravities – could be useful. Recent work in tropical forest biomass estimation supports the usefulness of speciﬁc gravity (Chave et al., 2005; Slik et al., 2010; Vieilledent et al., 2012).
Although this and our previous study make extensive use of existing data from independent studies, they are envisioned as an interim solution. The ﬁrst study and this update, coming a decade later, together highlight the still-evident need in the US for generalized biomass estimation based on new data collection. We strongly recommend new data be collected across the US – particularly for woodland species – but using strategic, welldesigned, theoretically based methods with agreed-upon protocols for data comparability. Such studies will better use scarce resources than more species-speciﬁc biomass studies based on data from small geographic areas, and could also provide data to deﬁnitively explain the differences between various approaches and determine which equations produce better estimates.

Appendix
Preliminary analyses and equation modiﬁcations
As discussed above, equations from 55 biomass studies were modiﬁed to ﬁt our criteria for estimating aboveground biomass. Nine of these 55 were complete regression reﬁts of raw biomass data published (Storey et al., 1955; Sollins and Anderson, 1971; Schnell, 1976; Johnston and Bartos, 1977; Miller et al., 1981; Strong and Roi, 1983; Sabatia, 2007) or graciously obtained from the authors (Karlik and Chojnacky unpublished (biomass data collected by Karlik and McKay, 2002), King et al., 2007). Twelve were relatively minor algebraic manipulations of available study information to obtain desired equation forms (Weetman and Harland, 1964; Harris et al., 1973; Whittaker et al., 1974; Reynolds et al., 1978; Schnell, 1978; Whisenant and Burzlaff, 1978; Harrington et al., 1984; Sachs, 1984; Tuskan and Rensema, 1992; Laxson et al., 1997; Naidu et al., 1998; Seiler et al., 2009). The remaining 34 studies involved modiﬁcations where 9 were regression reﬁts of equations to eliminate height as a predictor variable, 7 combined biomass components among similar studies, 15 needed an auxiliary foliage equation to estimate total aboveground biomass (1 also needed height elimination), and 4 required other analyses.
When regression was involved in these modiﬁcations, three principles were followed:
† Models were devised to best ﬁt data only within the diameter range of the particular study, either by polynomial regression (with weight as a function of diameter where needed) or logarithmic regression that sometimes included an additional diameter-term for more ﬂexibility in regression [ln(biomass) ¼ a + b ln(diameter) + c diameter].
† If predicted data from equations (pseudodata) were needed for regression reﬁt, these were generated uniformly within the diameter ranges of the equations given in studies (extrapolation outside this range was avoided except for a few cases).
† If auxiliary FIA data (FIA, 2010) were needed (for elimination of height or for other calculations, as described below), they were selected so as to correspond to the original study’s geographic area, species, stand origin (plantation or natural stand), and explicit diameter range.
Eliminating height variable
Equations from 9 studies were reﬁt as a function of diameter either by using author-published height-to-diameter equations (Ralston and Prince, 1965; Bella and De Franceschi, 1980) or by using select FIA (2010) data to predict biomass (using published equation) from height and diameter, then reﬁtting as a function of diameter. In other words, the regression reﬁt averaged the effect of the height variable by ﬁtting a new equation based on diameter only.
The 7 studies needing additional data to estimate biomass from height and diameter were matched with FIA data for a large

population of trees of similar geography (generally a state), similar stand origin, and within the diameter range of species of respective studies (Clark and Taras, 1976; Alban and Laidly, 1982; Van Lear et al., 1986; Jokela and Martin, 2000; Rubilar et al., 2005). Geographic exceptions included use of Alaska and Washington FIA data for a British Columbia study (Standish et al., 1985), and use of all plantation poplar data in the FIA database for a Washington study (Zabek and Prescott, 2006) because less than 2,000 plantation poplar trees were measured in the entire US and less than 50 in Washington.
Combining studies
There were few biomass equations for western North American species – particularly large-diameter trees – but there were some studies that reported either crown (foliage and branch) or bole (wood and bark) biomass equations, suggesting opportunities for combining equations among studies:
† A large study excluding crown biomass (Means et al., 1994) included 40 stem wood and bark biomass equations for 18 California, Oregon, and Washington conifer species for trees up to 100- to over 200-cm dbh. We ﬁrst reduced Means’ equations to 18 by reﬁtting when there was more than 1 equation per species and then matched these reﬁtted equations with auxiliary crown equations reﬁt from other studies. Auxiliary crown equations were constructed by generating genus-scale pseudodata from 76 foliage and/or branch equation estimates from 34 studies for the western US and Canada.
† We combined a study of stem material by Duursma et al. (2007) with Brown’s (1978) study of crown biomass for the same 10 conifer species in the Inland Northwest; auxiliary bark ratios were obtained from Van Hooser and Chojnacky (1983).
† A Nevada mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius) study (Chojnacky, 1984) lacked foliage, so a 6 per cent foliage-to(wood + bark + branch) ratio devised from Whittaker and Niering (1975) C. breviﬂorus data were used, and missing branch material less than 3.8 cm was extrapolated from ratios of known branch material mass (for diameters between 3.8 and 7.6 cm). Also for Nevada, a pinyon and juniper study (Chojnacky and Moisen, 1993) required volume equations (Chojnacky, 1985; Chojnacky, 1987) for a conversion method that also used FIA data.
† A large-tree mesquite (Prosopis spp.) equation was gained by combining green-weight biomass equations from El Fadl et al. (1989) with wood moisture content data from Felker et al. (1990).
† Finally, a Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii) crown biomass equation for trees 85 to 155 cm dbh was obtained by combining Ishii and Kadotani’s (2006) branch biomass equation with McCain’s (1994) foliage equation.
Foliage equation additions
There were 15 studies including 35 species in 19 genera where, because it was winter, stem wood, bark, and branches were measured but foliage (a minor part of tree biomass) was not. Forty-four percent of these species were oaks (Quercus) and maples (Acer). The rest were eastern hardwoods, except for poplar (in British Columbia), eastern redcedar (J. virginiana), and eastern hemlock

(Tsuga canadensis). We grouped 190 foliage equations from our database by genus, and used them to estimate foliage at a genus scale for the 15 studies. However, the maple equation was also used for 6 other genera (dogwood (Cornus), sassafras (Sassafras), sourwood (Oxydendrum), sycamore (Platanus), tupelo (Nyssa), and locust (Robinia)) because pseudodata for these were based on 3 or fewer equations each and their pseudodata variation was within that of maple.
Miscellaneous modiﬁcations
Four other studies required modiﬁcation:
† Biomass equations reported by Perala and Alban (1994) were recalculated by averaging pseudodata from equations developed for different soil types, and in a few cases also by using author-published height-to-dbh equations, to eliminate soil types and height in reﬁts.
† Reiners (1972) published biomass equations for Minnesota species but did not report a maximum dbh needed to generate pseudodata; basal area and trees per area for each species were reported instead of dbh range. Therefore, FIA (2010) data were used for counties included in the study area to model ‘a maximum dbh for each species’ from basal area and trees per acre (0.4047 ha); this maximum dbh was between 20 and 37 cm dbh for most species, but two extremes of 67 and 80 cm were set to 50 cm to guard against possible extrapolation error.
† Pearson et al. (1984) reported lodgepole pine (P. contorta) equations segmented into irregular diameter categories that were reﬁt into single-diameter equations.
† Ker and van Raalte (1981) equations were reﬁt using crown width and length equations obtained from Bragg (2001).
Excluded studies
Twelve studies were excluded because they summarized or duplicated biomass equations reported in other studies that we used (Baskerville, 1966; Clebsch, 1971; Fujimori et al., 1976; Santantonio et al., 1977; Stanek and State, 1978; Waring et al., 1978; Tritton and Hornbeck, 1982; Rauscher, 1984; Baldwin, 1987; Clark, 1987; Felker et al., 1990; Ter-Mikaelian and Korzukhin, 1997). Five studies were not used because the reported equations were not clear (Long and Turner, 1975; Ramseur and Kelly, 1981; Ruark and Bockheim, 1987; Tufekcioglu et al., 2003; Lieurance, 2007). Four studies that would have required modiﬁcation to eliminate height were excluded either because study trees were very small or because species were already well represented by other studies (Schaegel, 1975; Rowell and Carpenter, 1983; Bond-Lamberty et al., 2002; Oswald et al., 2010). Ten Canadian studies that ﬁt biomass equations as a function of dbh and height were not used because these data were included with the recent reanalysis by Lambert et al. (2005) of older Canadian biomass data (Johnstone and Peterson, 1980; Alemdag and Horton, 1981; Lavigne and Van Nostrand, 1981; Alemdag, 1981, 1982, 1983; Lavigne 1982; Singh 1982; Evert, 1983; Ouellet, 1985). Lastly, equations developed by Hu and Wang (2008) were not used because they were developed from FIA biomass estimates, which are based on volume-tobiomass conversion and other auxiliary information instead of direct measurement of biomass.
