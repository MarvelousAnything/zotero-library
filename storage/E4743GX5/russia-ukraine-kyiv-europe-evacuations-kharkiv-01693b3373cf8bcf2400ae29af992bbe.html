 President Vladimir Putin’s forces continued to pummel cities with 
rockets, and fierce fighting raged in places. In the face of the 
bombardments, Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces were showing unprecedented
 courage.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“The 
problem is that for one soldier of Ukraine, we have 10 Russian soldiers,
 and for one Ukrainian tank, we have 50 Russian tanks,” Zelenskyy told 
ABC News in an interview that aired Monday night. He noted that the gap 
in forces was diminishing and that even if Russian forces “come into all
 our cities,” they will be met with an insurgency.</p><div data-key="media-placeholder"><div class="YoutubeEmbed youtubeEmbed"><div class="vertical-wrapper"><div class="vertical-limit"></div><img alt="ratio" class="ratio" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAAAAAAeQfPuAAAAC0lEQVQYGWMYrAAAAJkAAWzZLOIAAAAASUVORK5CIIA="></div><div class="horizontal-limit"></div><div class="youtube-player" id="youtube-wrapper-sKSz3_yj1x8-article"><img class="thumbnail" src="" alt="Youtube video thumbnail"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">In
 one of the most desperate cities, the encircled southern port of 
Mariupol, an estimated 200,000 people — nearly half the population of 
430,000 — were hoping to flee, and Red Cross officials waited to hear 
when a corridor would be established.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 city is short on water, food and power, and cellphone networks are 
down. Stores have been looted as residents search for essential goods.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Police
 moved through the city, advising people to remain in shelters until 
they heard official messages broadcast over loudspeakers to evacuate.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Hospitals
 in Mariupol are facing severe shortages of antibiotics and painkillers,
 and doctors performed some emergency procedures without them.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 lack of phone service left anxious citizens approaching strangers to 
ask if they knew relatives living in other parts of the city and whether
 they were safe. </p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-75"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-33">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-36"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-34"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle2" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-32"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">In
 the capital, Kyiv, soldiers and volunteers have built hundreds of 
checkpoints to protect the city of nearly 4 million, often using 
sandbags, stacked tires and spiked cables. Some barricades looked 
significant, with heavy concrete slabs and sandbags piled more than two 
stories high, while others appeared more haphazard, with hundreds of 
books used to weigh down stacks of tires.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“Every house, every street, every checkpoint, we will fight to the death if necessary,” said Mayor Vitali Klitschko.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, with 1.4 million people, heavy shelling slammed into apartment buildings.</p><div class="relatedStory-0-2-81 Component-block-0-2-76"><div class="intro-0-2-82">Live Updates</div><ul class="list-0-2-83"><li class="relatedStory-0-2-101"><a class="link-0-2-102" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-europe-united-nations-evacuations-62fa232dcb9d6260fef0e9c7f5386f9a">– <!-- -->Suffering goes on in encircled Mariupol as evacuation fails</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-101"><a class="link-0-2-102" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskyy-kyiv-business-246eb3174b758602e09549f7fa348413">– <!-- -->Russia-Ukraine war: Key things to know about the conflict</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-101"><a class="link-0-2-102" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-new-zealand-global-trade-23327d0cb464c712ee042dfac159f1a2">– <!-- -->Live updates: Nissan plans to halt production in Russia</a></li></ul></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“I
 think it struck the fourth floor under us,” Dmitry Sedorenko said from 
his Kharkiv hospital bed. “Immediately, everything started burning and 
falling apart.” When the floor collapsed beneath him, he crawled out 
through the third story, past the bodies of some of his neighbors.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Klitschko reported that fierce battles continued in the Kyiv region, notably around Bucha, Hostomel, Vorzel and Irpin.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">In
 the Irpin area, which has been cut off from electricity, water and heat
 for three days, witnesses saw at least three tanks and said Russian 
soldiers were seizing houses and cars.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">A
 few miles away, in the small town of Horenka, where shelling reduced 
one area to ashes and shards of glass, rescuers and residents picked 
through the ruins as chickens pecked around them.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“What
 are they doing?” rescue worker Vasyl Oksak asked of the Russian 
attackers. “There were two little kids and two elderly people living 
here. Come in and see what they have done.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">In
 the south, Russian forces also continued their offensive in Mykolaiv, 
opening fire on the Black Sea shipbuilding center of a half-million 
people, according to Ukraine’s military. Rescuers said they were putting
 out fires caused by rocket attacks in residential areas.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">At
 The Hague, Netherlands, Ukraine pleaded with the International Court of
 Justice to order a halt to Russia’s invasion, saying Moscow is 
committing widespread war crimes.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Russia
 “is resorting to tactics reminiscent of medieval siege warfare, 
encircling cities, cutting off escape routes and pounding the civilian 
population with heavy ordnance,” said Jonathan Gimblett, a member of 
Ukraine’s legal team.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Russia snubbed the court proceedings, leaving its seats in the Great Hall of Justice empty.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Efforts
 to set up safe passage for civilians over the weekend fell apart amid 
continued Russian shelling. Before Monday’s talks began, Russia 
announced a new plan, saying civilians would be allowed to leave Kyiv, 
Mariupol, Kharkiv and Sumy.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">But
 many of the evacuation routes headed toward Russia or its ally Belarus,
 which has served as a launch pad for the invasion. Ukraine instead 
proposed eight routes allowing civilians to travel to western regions of
 the country where there is no shelling.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Later,
 Russia’s U.N. Ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told the U.N. Security 
Council that Russia would carry out a cease-fire Tuesday morning and 
appeared to suggest that humanitarian corridors leading away from Kyiv, 
Mariupol, Sumy and Chernigov could give people choice in where they want
 to go. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The U.N.
 humanitarian chief, Undersecretary-General Martin Griffiths, addressed 
the Security Council and urged safe passage for people to go “in the 
direction they choose.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Zelenskyy’s
 office would not comment on the Russian proposal, saying only that 
Moscow’s plans can be believed only if a safe evacuation begins. The 
office said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk planned to make a 
statement on the issue Tuesday morning.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 battle for Mariupol is crucial because its capture could allow Moscow 
to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine
 in 2014.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The fighting has sent <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-business-nancy-pelosi-economy-91fec47e5de9fa734fd0de9c402c2b99">energy prices surging worldwide and stocks plummeting</a><!-- -->, and threatens t <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-africa-lifestyle-middle-east-1b41faaa7ac0984d0673023b68d39a70">he food supply and livelihoods </a><!-- --> of people around the globe who rely on crops farmed in the fertile Black Sea region.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The U.N. human rights office reported 406 confirmed civilian deaths but said the real number is much higher. The invasion <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-entertainment-hungary-europe-united-nations-7900b60d15fc03d89e489c00eb6854a4">has also sent 1.7 million people fleeing Ukraine</a><!-- -->.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">On
 Monday, Moscow again announced a series of demands to stop the 
invasion, including that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia and 
recognize the eastern regions controlled by Moscow-supported separatist 
fighters as independent. It also insisted that Ukraine change its 
constitution to guarantee it won’t join international bodies like NATO 
and the EU. Ukraine has already rejected those demands. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Zelenskyy
 has called for more punitive measures against Russia, including a 
global boycott of its oil exports, which are key to its economy.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“If
 (Russia) doesn’t want to abide by civilized rules, then they shouldn’t 
receive goods and services from civilization,” he said in a video 
address. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">He has 
also asked for more warplanes. Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Wendy 
Sherman said officials are “trying to see whether this is possible and 
doable.” </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">While 
the West has been rushing weapons to Ukraine such as anti-tank and 
anti-aircraft missiles, some officials fear that sending warplanes could
 be seen by Moscow as direct involvement in the war.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">One
 possible scenario under discussion: Former Soviet bloc nations that are
 now NATO members could send Ukraine their own Soviet-era MiGs, which 
Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly, and the U.S. would then replace 
those countries’ aircraft with American-made F-16s.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Russia’s invasion has nearby countries terrified the war could spread to them.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-middle-east-estonia-antony-blinken-latvia-dde3c30bfc32e7c71e32e6c027ab12af">began a lightning visit </a><!-- -->
 to the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, former Soviet 
republics that are NATO members. Blinken hoped to reassure them of the 
alliance’s protection.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">NATO
 has shown no interest in sending troops into the country and has 
rejected Zelenskyy’s pleas to establish a no-fly zone for fear of 
triggering a wider war.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Associated Press reporters from around the world contributed to this report.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Follow the AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p></div></div></div><div class="Component-footer-0-2-1 -footer"><div class="fluid-wrapper"><div class="Component-grid-0-2-2"><nav class="Component-nav-0-2-3"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">AP NEWS</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-news">Top Stories</a></li><li><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/videos">Video</a></li><li><a href="mailto:support@apnews.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="https://apnews.com/accessibility-statement">Accessibility Statement</a></li><li><button class="optanon-show-settings">Cookie Settings</button></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-apps-0-2-4"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Download AP NEWS</div><div class="Component-downloadDescription-0-2-11">Connect with the definitive source for global and local news</div><div class="Component-list-0-2-13"></div></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-moreFromAp-0-2-5"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">More from AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/">ap.org</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://insights.ap.org/">AP Insights</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.ap.org/">AP Definitive Source Blog</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://apimagesblog.com/">AP Images Spotlight</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/explore/">AP Explore</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/books/">AP Books</a></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-followAp-0-2-6"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Follow AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-17"><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/AP" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-twitter"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/APNews" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-facebook"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AssociatedPress" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-youtube"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/associated-press" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-linkedin"></use></svg></a></li></ol></nav><div class="Component-divider-0-2-7 Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><div class="Component-legalStuff-0-2-8 Component-legalStuff-0-2-20"><nav class="Component-legalStuffNav-0-2-21"><div class="Component-title-0-2-24 Component-spaceBelow-0-2-27">The Associated Press</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-22"><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/about/">About</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/contact-us/">Contact</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://aphelp.ap.org/">Customer Support</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/careers/">Careers</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a href="https://apnews.com/termsofservice">Terms &amp;

A firefighter grabbed the boy's hand and his eyes blinked but he was otherwise still. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The city's streets were eerily empty, with most people sheltering indoors. But one man, Aleksander Ivanov, was pulling a trolley with his possessions in search of place to stay because shelling destroyed his home. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At the Brovary Central District Hospital on the eastern outskirts of Kyiv, a 14-year-old girl named Katya lay in bed with the covers pulled up to her neck. She and her father, who was still in surgery, were shot as the family was trying to evacuate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Katya's mother, identified only as Nina, stood by her side.

He claimed without providing evidence that the Mariupol hospital had been seized by far-right radical fighters who were using it as a base — despite the fact that photos and videos of the aftermath showed pregnant women and children at the site.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More than 2.3 million people have fled the war in Ukraine and an estimated 1.9 million are displaced within the country, a U.N. official said Thursday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ukrainian forces slowed or stopped a Russian advance that was trying to encircle Kyiv from the north to the west, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said Thursday night. It said Ukrainian forces also drove Russians out of Baklanova Muraviika, a village near Chernihiv that sits on a road to the capital.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Earlier Thursday, that office said Russian forces had captured several Kyiv suburbs, were trying to take Chernihiv and were advancing on the southern cities of Mykolaiv, Kryviy Rih, Voznesensk and Novovorontsovka. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said about 2 million people — half the residents of the Ukrainian capital’s metropolitan area — have left the city, which has become a virtual fortress.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Every street, every house … is being fortified,” he said in televised remarks. “Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Russia has deployed more than 150,000 troops and retains large and possibly decisive advantages in firepower, despite facing fierce Ukrainian resistance and global financial pressure aimed at crippling its economy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Russian forces on Thursday shelled a nuclear research institute in Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, setting buildings on fire, said Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Interior Ministry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Firefighters managed to extinguish the blazes, but Gerashchenko said a shell hit a building that houses equipment that could release radiation if it were damaged. According to the president’s office, there has been no change in the background radiation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Russia’s deputy energy minister, Yevgeny Grabchak, said Thursday that \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-science-business-nuclear-power-physics-4ef041a54e2d9293ec72c58d20e44225\">power was restored\u003c/a> to the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Rafael Grossi, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters Thursday in Vienna that the nuclear watchdog had ”scheduled physical inspections” of Ukraine's nuclear facilities, though he when or how those inspections would take place.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ABOUT DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Several rounds of talks between Ukraine and Russia haven't stopped the fighting, and a meeting Thursday in Turkey between Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, failed to find common ground.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In their highest-level talks since the war began, the two sides discussed a 24-hour cease-fire but didn't make progress toward one, Kuleba said. He said Russia was still seeking “surrender from Ukraine.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is not what they are going to get,” he said, adding that he was willing to continue the dialogue.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lavrov said Russia was ready for more negotiations but showed no sign of softening Moscow’s demands. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Russia has alleged that Western-looking, U.S.-backed Ukraine poses a threat to Russian security. Western officials suspect Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to install a Moscow-friendly government in Kyiv as part of an effort to draw the former Soviet state back into its orbit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>French President Emmanuel Macron joined the ranks of Western leaders who have condemned the Russian airstrike on the Mariupol hospital, calling it “a shameful and amoral act of war.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>During a visit to Poland, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-harris-embraces-calls-for-war-crimes-probe-792555553cca39ef9e1b4f1e7f8cebe6\">embraced calls for an international investigation\u003c/a>, though she stopped short of directly accusing Russia of having committed war crimes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT DEFENSIVE ASSISTANCE IS UKRAINE GETTING?\u003c/p>\u003cp>European nations have sent weapons to Ukraine’s military. Furthermore, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday night that \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-us-aid-package-41cc2e66c7714b37eca9d2bb8add53aa\">would rush $13.6 billion in American aid\u003c/a> to Ukraine and its European allies, nearly half of that for sending troops and weapons to Eastern Europe and equipping allied forces there. The bill is expected to pass through the Senate as well in the coming days.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Ukrainian government says about 20,000 foreigners have joined the so-called the International Legion for the Territorial Defense of Ukraine, where they are given weapons to fight when they arrive. Among them are about 100 of the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-d0243a1708a3115e5ad0ac40aed99b9f\">several thousand Americans\u003c/a> who asked to join the fight, a Ukrainian official said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT’S THE VIEW FROM INSIDE RUSSIA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>During a televised meeting with Kremlin officials on Thursday, Putin addressed the Western sanctions that have caused the ruble to crash and led many major companies to leave Russia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The pressure of sanctions has always been there. Yes, of course, now it is complex and creates certain challenges, problems, difficulties for us. But just as we overcame these difficulties in the previous years, we will overcome them now. We must go through this period. The economy will certainly adapt to the new situation.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>The list of companies that have stopped operating in Russia grew Thursday, with German fashion brand Hugo Boss temporarily closing its stores and U.S.-based hotel chains Hilton and Marriott closing their Moscow offices, though their Russian hotels are owned and operated by franchisees and will stay open. The Walt Disney Co. said that in addition to pausing film releases in Russia, as previously announced, it was also “taking steps to pause all other businesses” there. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Goldman Sachs said it would close its operations in Russia entirely, making it the first major Wall Street bank to do so since Russia invaded Ukraine.

Victory in the Club World Cup last month completed the set of major honors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The success has been funded by around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) of loans to the club that Abramovich said he didn't want repaid when putting the club up for sale last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHY SANCTION ABRAMOVICH?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich has used legal means to try to publicly distance himself from benefiting from an association with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The British government thinks otherwise, saying Abramovich has obtained “a financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the government of Russia,\" including tax breaks, the sale of shares at favorable rates, and contracts in the buildup to Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich “is or has been involved in destabilizing Ukraine” via Evraz, a steel manufacturing and mining company which he effectively controls and has potentially supplied the Russia military, the government said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His fortune was made in oil and aluminium following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2005, Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom paid $13 billion for the Sibneft oil company controlled by Abramovich. It allowed Putin’s Kremlin to recapture state influence in the lucrative energy industry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON CHELSEA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The sanctions could have immediately forced Chelsea to stop running as a business, and preventing its teams from completing their seasons.

A maximum of 20,000 pounds can be spent on travel to matches. Chelsea plays in France at Lille in the Champions League next week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Player recruitment is also prohibited under the terms of the government license that runs through May 31.
