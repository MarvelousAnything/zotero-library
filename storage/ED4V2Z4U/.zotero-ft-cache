The United States, Canada and European allies are preparing to target Russian financial institutions, including the nation’s central bank, with major restrictions in what would be a significant escalation of their efforts to punish the Kremlin for its invasion of Ukraine, the allies said in a joint statement Saturday evening as air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv.

The allies said they would block the Russian central bank from accessing hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves in the West, a move that could lead to financial panic in that country as it tries to pay for its new war. They also vowed to cut off Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system , a network that connects banks around the world and is considered the backbone of international finance.

Fighting receded during daylight hours Saturday, but missile strikes continued to bombard the Ukrainian capital and other cities. Authorities imposed a 5 p.m. curfew.

Here’s what to know:

    On Saturday morning, a high-rise apartment building near one of Kyiv’s international airports was struck by a missile as air raids continued.
    Ukraine’s health minister said 198 Ukrainians have been killed in the fighting, with more than 1,000 wounded. There were already signs of a mass exodus. The United Nations said Saturday that more than 150,000 Ukrainians have fled the country. Later it said there had been “at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 dead.”
    Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a video of himself at daybreak Saturday appearing resolved to remain in Kyiv, even as Western officials warned that Russia plans to capture or kill him.
    Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Poland, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic have moved to shut their airspace to Russian airlines. Estonia’s prime minister called on all European Union countries to do the same.

KYIV, Ukraine — Yuri Shuklin has never fired a gun, not a real one at least. His war experience, he said, comes from playing video games such as “Call to Action.” “Maybe it’s funny, but in some movies and video games, they have nice [battlefield] tactics,” he said.

By Saturday, he had signed up to fight the Russian forces pressing on this capital.

In Ukraine, there’s precedent for Shuklin’s screen-to-reality sense of confidence: President Volodymyr Zelensky was an actor and comedian, whose only political experience before getting elected was playing the role of Ukraine’s president in a satirical TV series. Now, those savvy communication skills, his ability to sway audiences via social media, a healthy dose of grit and defiance — and not least of all, his readiness to die if necessary — has transformed him into an unlikely champion for Ukrainians and the world.

Shuklin, who once never cared about politics, is among Zelensky’s devotees.

“This man did not jump away to some other country like previous presidents,” said the tall and lean 31-year-old mechanic. “He can show us the way.”

Until three days ago, when the Russians invaded, Zelensky’s political tenure was mixed, even considered by many on the decline. He was criticized for not pushing forward essential anti-corruption and judicial reforms. Ukrainians felt he was weak in his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and too quick to seek compromise with Moscow.

Pro-Ukraine protesters find their way, one by one, to Russian Embassy in D.C.

Outside the Russian Embassy on Boris Nemtsov Plaza in Washington, the sound of honking filled the air. It was noon on Saturday, and a dozen people had found their way there. The invasion of Ukraine was unfolding thousands of miles away, but here, they felt a sense of purpose.

They held signs and balloons in Ukraine’s national colors. As vehicles passed on Wisconsin Avenue NW, drivers sounded their support.

The group was ragtag, drawn by a shared propulsion to do something, rather than an organized effort. There was a couple from North Carolina, who had traveled to Washington for a soccer match. And a woman from Peru. And a Ukrainian couple, who couldn’t speak English but stood quietly among the gaggle.

“NO WAR,” read one of their cardboard signs. “INVADERS OUT OF UKRAINE!” read another. One man, holding an orange poster, approached one of the embassy surveillance cameras and held up his sign: “It’s okay to defect.”

Pilar Viliarromero, 65, taped a small sign to the concrete that read: “Six things the Lord hates … hands that shed innocent blood.”

    London Philharmonic Orchestra played the Ukrainian national anthem before tonight’s concert. Whole auditorium stood and applauded pic.twitter.com/9Co9XlfYAZ
    — David Knowles (@djknowles22) February 26, 2022 

The London Philharmonic Orchestra elicited a standing ovation Saturday when it started its “From Russia With Love” concert with the Ukrainian national anthem in a show of solidarity for the invaded nation.

The musicians were to present two pieces by Russian composers Sergei Rachmaninoff and Sergei Prokofiev, according to the concert’s program . But before delving into the “heartfelt melody and sparkling wit” of Prokofiev’s Violin Concerto No. 2 and the “blissful love-song” of Rachmaninoff’s Second Symphony, the musicians began with “Shche ne vmerla Ukrainy” or “Ukraine Has Not Yet Perished” at Southbank Center’s Royal Festival Hall.

The philharmonic’s artistic director, Elena Dubinets — who said she is Russian and married to a Ukrainian — gave a speech condemning “the war instigated by the government of my native country against his native country.”

“The program was designed a couple of years ago, but the accidental timing of our concert that coincided with the beginning of this war, has given us a reason to believe that this music can speak for itself and will help us during these terrible times,” Dubinets said.

As conductor Alpesh Chauhan led the players into Ukraine’s national anthem, the audience rose to its feet — a sight widely shared across social media.

“Thank you to @LPOrchestra for beginning their beautiful Rachmaninov/Prokofiev concert tonight with the most stirring rendition of the Ukrainian national anthem,” concertgoer Rachel Law wrote on Twitter. “A packed Southbank Centre on its feet to stand with Ukraine.”

Chinese ambassador remains in Ukraine, urges citizens to remain calm

China’s ambassador to Ukraine said he is still in the country and has urged Chinese citizens there to remain calm amid intensifying Russian attacks.

In a video posted online, Fan Xianrong said that he has received a deluge of anxious reports over the welfare of Chinese citizens and that the embassy is taking steps to ensure their safety.

“I ask everyone to rest assured and have confidence the Chinese Embassy will never ignore anyone’s safety,” he said in the address recorded near a Chinese flag. “I know many people want to go back to China. … What I can tell you clearly is that as long as the safety conditions are met, everyone’s safety is guaranteed. We will make appropriate arrangements.”

Fan did not comment on the wider conflict, which Chinese officials have declined to label as an invasion. Beijing has instead heaped scorn on the United States and NATO, which it says are provoking conflict in the region.

The Chinese Embassy in Ukraine announced Thursday that it would arrange charter flights to evacuate its citizens from Ukraine, but unlike many other countries, it did not call for them to leave the country before the invasion. China has said it has about 6,000 citizens in Ukraine.

Trump praises Putin but calls invasion ‘appalling’

Former president Donald Trump again lauded Russian President Vladimir Putin as “smart,” telling a crowd of his most ardent supporters that the problem is not with Putin, but that U.S. leaders “are dumb.”

Most of Trump’s comments about the Russian invasion of Ukraine during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando on Saturday were focused on himself and his grievances; he and Putin understood each other, Trump said, so this wouldn’t be happening if he were still president.

He mildly criticized Russia’s invasion of Ukraine without denigrating Putin directly, saying it’s “appalling and it’s an outrage and an atrocity that should never have been allowed to occur.” It would never have happened “if our election was not rigged,” he said — a reference to Trump’s false assertion that a 2020 election win was stolen from him.

The former president called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a “brave man,” then quickly qualified his affinity for Zelensky, who was the central figure in the 2019 impeachment charges against Trump. At the time, Zelensky said he hadn’t felt pressured during a phone call in which Trump conditioned U.S. military aid on Ukraine digging up dirt on Joe Biden and his family.

Before his CPAC remarks, Trump told reporters that the war in Ukraine could “spread throughout the world.”

“This could be a world war,” he said. “Something has to be done.”

Asked what specifically should be done, Trump said there were things “that would end it very quickly,” but he wasn’t going to talk about them to the news media.

The ravine where the massacres took place looked like a dusty river bed. In 1941, it was outside Kyiv, Ukraine, out of sight. The sound of gunfire from within didn’t carry far.

Over two days that September, more than 33,000 people were executed there by Nazi killing squads in one of the worst mass murders of Jews during the Holocaust of World War II.

Today, the notorious site is inside Kyiv city limits. It’s called Babyn Yar, or Babi Yar, and the invading Russian soldiers fighting to subdue the city might notice the monuments to those who were murdered there.

Thousands of Ukrainians scrambled to flee as Russian attacks on the country continue . Many border crossings to neighboring countries are seeing a massive influx of people.

Satellite images on Friday showed a four-mile-long line of vehicles waiting to cross a checkpoint at Siret, Romania. Romania’s border police say more than 30,000 Ukrainians have crossed the border since Thursday. The Romanian defense minister said earlier this week that the NATO country of 19 million could take in up to a half-million refugees.

In total, more than 150,000 Ukrainian refugees have crossed into neighboring countries, the United Nations’ high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said Saturday. Many others are attempting to leave the country in hopes of escaping conflict in the capital Kyiv and other eastern cities.

According to the U.N., the majority of Ukrainians fled to Poland and Moldova in the first 48 hours of conflict. Deputy Minister Pawel Szefernaker of Poland said Saturday 115,000 people have crossed into that country since Thursday.

It was 3:15 a.m. in Belgorod, Russia — much too early for a traffic jam, thought Jeffrey Lewis, who was watching the traffic pileup on Google Maps.

Lewis, a professor specializing in arms control and nonproliferation at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif., was monitoring Google Maps with a research team of students he mentors as part of a project to analyze images taken from space. He and his team realized what was happening: a Russian armored unit was moving toward the border with Ukraine.

By combining Google Maps traffic information with a radar image that showed troops, Lewis and his team realized an invasion was underway hours before the news became public and from thousands of miles away in California. Russia officially announced its assault on Ukraine on Thursday morning, which President Biden called “unprovoked and unjustified.”

LONDON — Oleg Paska says his mother may be an “old woman,” but she is not scared.

Paska, 56, recently moved to the United Kingdom after years traveling for work but was born and raised in Ukraine, where many members of his family live, including his “brave” 84-year-old mother in the western city of Khmelnitsky, he said.

“She has survived a lot,” he said in an interview with The Washington Post after Russia launched its assault on Ukraine on Thursday , forcing families to flee and prompting Western officials to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin for “bringing war back to Europe.”

“My mother and grandmother were nearly killed during the Second World War,” Paska said, explaining that his mother “still remembers the terror” of Nazi atrocities in Europe. This time she is preparing and she is ready, Paska said. “She tells me she is not afraid,” he said.

Although images of smoldering apartment buildings and unsuspecting cyclists cut down by incoming fire have ricocheted across social media, the cumulative toll of Russia’s invasion has been obscured by a bevy of factors, including international observers unable to do their work, a sprawling conflict zone in Europe’s largest nation, a government in disarray as it fights for survival, and a steady drip of misinformation.

To those tasked with helping to protect the lives of noncombatants, the result has been a frustrating void at a time when civilian casualties are undoubtedly increasing.

“It’s an incredibly worrying situation. We don’t have any idea of the full scale of the consequences right now,” said Mirella Hodeib, spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Kyiv. “Only that they’re rising exponentially.”

Hodeib spoke from a bunker in Ukraine’s capital city as combat continued unabated aboveground. The organization has a 600-member staff in Ukraine, Hodeib said. But nearly all have had to take shelter, with conditions too dangerous to effectively track how Ukrainians are faring while Russian troops advance and war planes fire their missiles.

10 people of Greek origin among the dead in Ukraine

Greece’s Foreign Ministry said Saturday that 10 people of Greek origin were killed and six others injured in fighting near Mariupol, a city in southeastern Ukraine and home to many from the Greek diaspora.

“Stop the bombing now!” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis wrote on Twitter.

    10 innocent civilians of Greek origin killed today by Russian air strikes close to Mariupol. Stop the bombing now!
    — Prime Minister GR (@PrimeministerGR) February 26, 2022 

Greece’s Foreign Ministry said Saturday that 10 people of Greek origin were killed and six others injured in fighting near Mariupol, a city in southeastern Ukraine and home to many from the Greek diaspora.

Greece appears to be the first country outside Ukraine and Russia to claim that its people have died in the fighting.

The fatalities include six people from the village of Sartana and four from Buhas. In Sartana, about six miles from Mariupol, six people — including one child — were injured, Greece’s Foreign Ministry said in news releases . At least 240 civilians have died because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United Nations said Saturday.

The deaths of the people of Greek origin — whose identities were not released — prompted Greek government officials to summon the Russian ambassador in Athens to the Foreign Ministry for a meeting Monday, according to a statement from Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias.

“Aerial attacks against civilians … are unacceptable criminal actions,” the government agency said in a news release . “We condemn them unequivocally. We call on the Russian Federation to immediately halt airstrikes and any action targeting civilians.”

In Ukraine, nearly all people of Greek origin reside by Mariupol, Ukraine’s 10th-largest city. Located in the Donetsk oblast, the city of about 400,000 has more than 100,000 people of Greek origin.

Russia claims to explode Ukrainian dam that had blocked water to Crimea

Video verified by The Washington Post captured a large explosion at a dam along the Northern Crimean Canal on Saturday that had been a source of increasing tensions between Russia and Ukraine over water rights.

Russian media shared the video , saying Russian military forces were responsible for the destruction. It is unclear who originally recorded the video.

The first frames of the video show that the bridge crossing the river had already fallen by the time of the explosion. Then, a large cloud of black and grey dust enveloped the area. Rubble showers down into the river.

Recent images show that the bridge was intact as recently as January.

Ukraine built the makeshift dam in 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea, blocking what had been a main source of water for the region. Hostilities over it increased in recent months after a drought worsened Crimea’s water crisis, and Ukraine made efforts to build a more permanent piece of infrastructure. Reports from as early as May 2021 suggested the situation was serious enough that residents in the area, roughly 10 miles from the Crimea border, were preparing for war.

Elon Musk promises to send Starlink terminals to Ukraine

In response to a plea from a Ukrainian official , Elon Musk on Saturday tweeted that the Starlink Internet service that SpaceX provides from its orbital satellite constellation is up and running in the war-torn country and that more ground terminals are on the way.

The system could help Ukrainians continue to access the Internet, and be able to communicate and gain valuable information, even if broadband is severed on the ground.

    Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route.
    — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 26, 2022 

Starlink’s constellation of satellites beams Internet signals to ground terminals, much in the way that satellite television, such as DirecTV, allows consumers to access programming.

On Saturday, Mykhailo Fedorov, the vice prime minister of Ukraine and the country’s minister of digital transformation, tagged Musk in a tweet asking Musk to “provide Ukraine with Starlink stations.” Several hours later, Musk replied that “Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route.”

It wasn’t clear how many customers SpaceX has in Ukraine for the service or how widespread it is in Ukraine, though coverage maps indicate the service is available nearly 24 hours a day. SpaceX has been launching many batches of the satellites into Earth orbit and has achieved operational capability, but is still planning on putting up many more satellites for better coverage.

Still, the news was welcomed in Ukraine.

“Starlink terminals are coming to Ukraine!” Fedorov tweeted . “Thank you @elonmusk, thank you everyone who supported Ukraine!”

The exchange followed another on Friday in which Musk offered SpaceX’s services.

After Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the Russian space agency, threatened that Russia may stop using its spacecraft thrusters to periodically boost the International Space Station, Musk indicated that SpaceX could do it with its Dragon spacecraft, which regularly fly to the station.

War in Ukraine: What you need to know

The latest: Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey ended without an agreement as President Zelensky condemned as an atrocity a Russian airstrike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol that killed at least 3 people. Meanwhile, in the U.S., House lawmakers approved new humanitarian, economic and military assistance to Ukraine worth approximately $14 billion .

Oil exports: Russia is the world’s largest oil exporter, sending more than 7 million barrels of crude oil to countries around the world , including to Germany and other E.U. members.

The fight: Casualties are mounting in Ukraine — including civilians, while Moscow is facing allegations that it has used cluster and vacuum weapons . As many as 4,000 Russian soldiers may have died , according to a U.S. general.

Map: Russia’s assault on Ukraine has been extensive with strikes and attacks across the entire country.

The response: Russia’s war could be a global economic “game changer,” with rising gas prices and shifting trade decisions suggesting change that will be felt for years. Meanwhile, in Russia, online access has been significantly curtailed by censors at home and businesses abroad.
