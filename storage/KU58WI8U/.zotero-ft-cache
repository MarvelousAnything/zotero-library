Abstract

Predator—prey theory is traced from its origins in the Malthus—Verhulst logistic equations, through the Lotka—Volterra equations, logistic modifications to both prey and predator equations, incorporation of the Michaelis—Menten—Holling functional response into the predator and prey equations, and the recent development of ratio—dependent functional responses and per—capita rate of change functions. Some of the problems of classical predator–prey theory, including the paradoxes of enrichment and biological control, seem to have been caused by the application of the principle of mass action to predator–prey interactions. Predator–prey models that evolved from logistic theory or that incorporate ratio—dependent functional responses do not have these problems and also seem to be more biologically plausible.
