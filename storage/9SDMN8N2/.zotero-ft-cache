    The US has condemned Russia for its attack and capture of the largest nuclear power station in Europe at an emergency UN Security Council meeting, calling it “reckless” and “dangerous”.
    A fire broke out at the complex in the southeastern city of Enerhodar early on Friday morning, but it has now been extinguished.
    Ukraine, its Western allies and the United Nations’s nuclear watchdog have said a Russian attack sparked the blaze.
    Russia has denied attacking the site and blamed the fire, which Kyiv claims killed “several” people, on Ukrainian “saboteurs”.
    Russia’s offensive has sparked a mass exodus from Ukraine and a rapidly escalating humanitarian crisis .

Biden meets Niinisto as support grows in Finland for NATO

US leader Joe Biden and his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niinisto agreed on Friday to deepen ties but stopped short of making public security guarantees or suggesting that Finland could join NATO after Russia’s Ukraine invasion.

Biden said during the White House meeting that Finland is a “strong defense partner” involved in a “united trans-Atlantic response to holding Russia accountable” for what he called an attack on global peace.

“We are really living in very difficult times,” said Niinisto. “I want to thank you also for the leadership you have showed. We need it now.”

Not clear if nuclear site safe: Former IAEA official

Speaking from Vienna, Austria, a former IAEA official told Al Jazeera it was not yet clear if the Zaporizhzhia facility was secure.

“We can’t really tell if its [nuclear plant] is safe or not, especially if the operators of the nuclear power plant are sitting at their desk, with Russian soldiers with guns behind them.

“According to the state nuclear regulatory inspector of Ukraine, which is … responsible for the safe operation of nuclear power plants … has pointed out that many of these operators have been working very long shifts and have not had rest,” Tariq Rauf said.

“Therefore, they may not be in a position to properly monitor the control room and to monitor the reactor that is running,” he added.

‘No-fly zone’ means NATO would have to directly engage Russia: Ex-US official

A former US deputy assistant secretary of state has said that imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine could drag NATO and Western nations into a direct confrontation with Russia.

Joel Rubin’s comments came after NATO earlier rejected calls from Ukrainian leaders to enforce a no-fly zone amid Russia’s continued attacks on the country.

“It’s not just a call for a no-fly zone and then aircraft cease. What this would mean is that NATO would be directly engaging Russian military aircraft, and if the aircraft were to fly, NATO would be obligated to shoot them down. So that’s what we’re talking about here. It’s a horrible conundrum,” Rubin told Al Jazeera.

“NATO is part of that puzzle in trying to push back against Russia and to get Vladimir Putin to back off,” Rubin added. “He needs to pull back, accept a negotiated outcome and stop killing innocent civilians in Ukraine.”

Ministers of G7 urge Russia to stop attacks in vicinity of nuclear plants

G7 foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and US released a joint statement condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine and calling on Moscow to end its “aggression” and immediately withdraw its forces.

“We urge Russia to stop its attacks especially in the direct vicinity of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants,” the statement said.

“Any armed attack on and threat against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the principles of international law. We support the initiative of IAEA Director General Grossi announced today for an agreement between Ukraine and Russia to ensure the safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine.”

Russian envoy dismisses reports of attack on nuclear plant

Moscow’s envoy to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, has dismissed reports that Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as “lies” and “disinformation”.

“You’re trying to present the situation in such a way as though the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was allegedly shelled by the Russian military as a result of which a fire broke out,” Nebenzya told the UN Security Council. “These statements are simply untrue.”

Nebenzya said Ukrainian “saboteurs” fired at Russian forces from a training facility outside the power plant early on Friday.

“The Russian patrol returned fire on the firing points of the Ukrainian saboteurs in the building of the training complex and suppressed their fire. As they were leaving the Ukrainian sabotage group set fire to the training facility,” Nebenzya said.

He stressed that Russian forces are not interfering with the work of the plant’s operators but are trying to ensure the security of the facility.

Russia committing war crimes, crimes against humanity: Ukraine’s UN envoy

Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, has accused Russia of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity during its invasion of the country.

“Russia has resorted to war crimes and crimes against humanity. Russia does not even try to hide them,” Kyslytsya said.

“Residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages across the country are being ruined by Russian bombs, shells and missiles. Peaceful civilians are being killed, critical infrastructure totally damaged.”

The International Criminal Court prosecutor this week launched a probe into potential war crimes committed in Ukraine, dating back to 2013.

Navalny calls for March 6 protests in Russia, across the world

Jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny has called on Russians to protest against the war in Ukraine in cities across Russia and the world on March 6.

“Show the world that Russians don’t want war. Come out in the squares of Berlin, New York, Amsterdam or Melbourne, wherever you are. Now we are all responsible for Russia’s future. For what Russia will be in the eyes of the world,” Navalny said in a post on his blog.

“You may be scared, but to submit to this fear is to side with fascists and murderers. Putin has already snatched away from Russia its economy, relations with the world and hope for a future,” he added.

Several rounds of anti-war protests have already taken place in cities across Russia. More than 8,000 people have been arrested for taking part in the demonstrations, according to protest monitoring group OVD-Info.

Ukraine reports deaths from nuclear plant blaze

Ukraine’s foreign ministry says that “several” people were killed and wounded in the now-extinguished fire that broke out as a result of Russia’s alleged attack on the Zaporizhzhia plant.

The site’s employees are monitoring the plant to make sure it is operating safely and that radiation levels do not spike following the blaze, the ministry, which did not specify an exact death toll, added in a statement on Facebook.

But it warned there could be major radioactive damage if the facility’s cooling process is disturbed.

“Thousands of people – including civilians who are currently unable to evacuate the area near the plant due to ongoing shelling and fighting – would be hurt by this,” the ministry said.

It also called for Kyiv’s allies to take “urgent steps” to force Russian troops to withdraw from the area in order to ensure the facility’s safety.

Moscow has blamed the attack at the site on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a “monstrous provocation”.

NATO chief warns of ‘more deaths and suffering’ to come

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has warned the war in Ukraine will lead to more deaths and destruction over the coming days as he appealed to Putin to withdraw all Russian troops without conditions.

“The days to come are likely to be worse, with more deaths, more suffering and more destruction,” Stoltenberg told reporters after a meeting of the alliance’s foreign ministers at NATO’s headquarters in Brussels.

But he ruled out sending NATO troops to Ukraine or setting up a no-fly zone over the country, as has been requested by Kyiv, amid fears such moves would draw the alliance into a direct military confrontation with Russia.

“Allies agree we should not have NATO planes operating in Ukrainian air space or NATO troops on Ukraine’s territory,” Stoltenberg said.

Majority of Swedes now in favour of joining NATO: Poll

A majority of Swedes are now in favour of joining NATO following Russia’s invasion, according to a new opinion poll, with Moscow’s assault seemingly spurring a rapid shift in attitudes in a country long known for neutrality.

A poll commissioned by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet showed 51 percent of Swedes are now in favour of NATO, up from 42 percent in January. The number of those opposed to joining the alliance fell to 27 percent from 37 percent.

The data, compiled by Demoskop, marks the first time any poll has shown a majority of Swedes back NATO membership.

Stoltenberg said in January that Sweden could join the alliance “very quickly” if it decided to apply for membership.

“I would … advise them [our neighbours] not to escalate the situation, not to introduce any restrictions,” the Russian president said in televised remarks.

“We do not see any need here to aggravate or worsen our relations. And all our actions, if they arise, they always arise exclusively in response to some unfriendly actions, actions against the Russian Federation,” he added.

“I think everyone must think about how to normalise relations, co-operate normally and develop relations normally.”

Russia blames attack at nuclear power station on Ukrainian saboteurs

Russia’s defence ministry has blamed the attack at the Zaporizhzhia plant on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a “monstrous provocation”.

Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the facility was operating normally and claimed the area had been under Russian control since Monday.

“However, last night, on the territory adjacent to the power plant, an attempt was made by the Kyiv nationalist regime to carry out a monstrous provocation,” Konashenkov said.

“On March 4 at about 2 am during a patrol of guarded territory adjacent to the … plant, a mobile patrol of the National Guard came under attack from a Ukrainian sabotage group,” he added.

“To provoke return fire on the building, heavy small arms fire was opened on Russian National Guard servicemen from the windows of several floors of a training complex located outside the power plant.”

Konashenkov said the Russian patrol returned fire to suppress the attack, and the “sabotage group” abandoned the training complex, setting fire to it as they left.

His account was diametrically opposed to the version of events put forward by Kyiv, which said Russian forces attacked the plant in the early hours of Friday, setting an adjacent five-storey training facility on fire.

Al Jazeera could not independently verify either the Russian or the Ukrainian account of the incident.

No radiation release at Ukraine plant, UN nuclear watchdog says

The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog says there has been no release of radioactive material at the Zaporizhzhia plant following Russia’s alleged attack on the site.

Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had been in contact with the Ukrainian nuclear regulator and staff at the Zaporizhzhia plant.

Addressing reporters at the IAEA’s headquarters in Vienna, Grossi said no damage had been done to the site’s six reactors but that two people on the site were injured in the fire there.

He added that the plant’s operators and the Ukrainian regulator have warned the situation at the site “continues to be extremely tense and challenging”.

Of the plant’s reactor units, Unit 1 is shut down for maintenance, Units 2 and 3 have undergone a controlled shut down, Unit 4 is operating at 60 percent power and Units 5 and 6 are being held “in reserve” in low power mode, according to the IAEA.

Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull, reporting from the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, says the miles-long Russian military convoy north of Kyiv “is essentially stalled”.

“According to satellite imagery and Western intelligence agencies … it hasn’t moved, barely an inch, in three days now,” Hull said.

“They speculate about the causes of that, they are potentially multiple – logistical, mechanical, morale-related and potentially resistance-related as well,” he added.

“There are suggestions that all sorts of things are going wrong … but the simple fact is this convoy may be bogged down now, but it is at some point going to get started again.”

NATO will defend all its allies and territory in the event of any Russian attack on the United States-led transatlantic military alliance, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.

“Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us we are ready for it and we will defend every inch of NATO territory,” Blinken told reporters as he arrived for a meeting of the alliance’s foreign ministers in Brussels.

“And overnight, we’ve also seen reports about the attack against a nuclear power plant. This just demonstrates the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it and the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops and engaging in good faith in diplomatic efforts,” he added.

Russia to introduce jail terms for spreading ‘fake’ information about army

Russia’s lower house of parliament has approved a proposed law that would allow authorities to imprison people for up to 15 years if they are convicted of spreading intentionally “fake” information about the country’s armed forces.

The bill, which also makes calling for sanctions against Russia a criminal offence, comes as Moscow ramps up its efforts to control the domestic narrative over its war in Ukraine.

“If the fakes lead to serious consequences then imprisonment of up to 15 years threatens,” the lower house of parliament, known as the Duma in Russian, said in a statement.

Russia’s upper house of parliament must now approve the bill, which it is expected to do, after which it will be passed to Putin for him to sign it into law.

Calls for NATO no-fly zone in Ukraine ‘irresponsible’, Lithuanian PM says

Calls for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone in Ukraine are irresponsible, Lithuania’s prime minister has said, warning such a measure would risk dragging the alliance into direct conflict with Russia.

“I believe that all encouragements for NATO to get involved in the military conflict now are irresponsible,” Ingrida Simonyte told a news conference in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius.

The term “no-fly zone” refers to an area of airspace in which it has been determined that certain aircraft are not permitted to fly. In a conflict setting, the measure is primarily used to prevent aerial attacks from taking place.

Nuclear reactors ‘not meant to be exposed to missiles’, analyst says

Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, said “we don’t know much” about the details of the fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

But, these machines are “not meant to be exposed to missiles and high explosives – they’re not designed for this,” Sokolski told Al Jazeera.

“The power plant itself, if it was hit, would not generate the radioactivity or in all likelihood that Chernobyl did,” he said, referring to the site of a plant where radioactivity is still leaking from history’s worst nuclear disaster 36 years ago.

“But if the spent fuel pond, which is where they put the used fuel, was hit – it could easily by a multiple of the effect of Chernobyl,” he said. “It depends on what you hit and what happens to what you hit.”
