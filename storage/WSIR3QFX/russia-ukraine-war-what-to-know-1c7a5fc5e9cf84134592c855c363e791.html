 troops have been advancing slowly on the capital city of nearly 3 
million people. On Monday, a military convoy consisting of hundreds of 
armored vehicles, tanks, artillery and support vehicles was no more than
 17 miles (25 kilometers) from the city center, according to satellite 
imagery from the Maxar company. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">It
 was believed earlier Monday to be 17 miles (25 kilometers) long, but 
additional satellite imagery showed it stretching for 40 miles. Maxar 
said the newer images cover a wider area and were less obscured by 
clouds. Several homes and other buildings were seen burning near roads 
where the convoy is traveling.</p><div class="relatedStory-0-2-98 Component-block-0-2-93"><div class="intro-0-2-99">Live Updates</div><ul class="list-0-2-100"><li class="relatedStory-0-2-101"><a class="link-0-2-102" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-united-nations-general-assembly-kyiv-business-migration-fa779fd0b8bb8ea2fea46d33500c1c10">– <!-- -->Russia-Ukraine War: Russia steps up attack on Ukraine cities</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-101"><a class="link-0-2-102" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-6bcdf50c08dd62a4c5305aa34d045cce">– <!-- -->Live updates: Ukraine gets $34M in cryptocurrency donations</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-101"><a class="link-0-2-102" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-abc3e297725e57e6052529d844b5ee2f">– <!-- -->Russia takes aim at urban areas; Biden vows Putin will 'pay'</a></li></ul></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">HOW ARE ORDINARY UKRAINIANS COPING?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Long lines formed outside Kyiv supermarkets Monday as <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ee7cdf19bdab43a22cb1391c98c62b4d">residents were allowed out of bomb shelters</a><!-- --> and homes for the first time since a curfew was imposed Saturday.

 at night in Kyiv’s subway system and other makeshift shelters around 
the country, where parents try to calm their children’s fears. Despite 
the shortages, lack of privacy and other challenges, Ukrainians were 
trying to put on a brave face. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">“It’s
 much harder for soldiers at the front. It’s embarrassing to complain 
about the icy floor, drafts and terrible toilets,” said 74-year-old 
Irina, who sought safety in a Kyiv underground station and would not 
give her last name. Her grandson Anton is among those fighting in 
eastern Ukraine.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Ukrainian
 authorities said at least seven people were killed and dozens were 
injured in fighting in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, where
 social media videos showed apartment buildings being shelled. They 
warned that the actual figures could be much higher.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">U.N.
 human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said her office had confirmed that
 102 civilians, including seven children, have been killed in the 
Russian invasion and 304 others wounded since Thursday, though she 
cautioned the tally was likely a vast undercount. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR DIPLOMACY?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Ukrainian
 and Russian delegations met Monday on Ukraine’s border with Belarus. 
The meeting ended with no immediate reports of agreements, but Mykhailo 
Podolyak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said
 further talks could take place “in the near future.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Before the meeting, Zelenskyy’s office said Ukraine would demand an immediate cease-fire.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">While
 Ukraine sent its defense minister and other top officials, the Russian 
delegation was led by Putin’s cultural adviser — Vladimir Medinsky — an 
unlikely envoy for ending the war and a sign of how Moscow viewed the 
talks. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Medinsky 
said the sides “found certain points on which common positions could be 
foreseen.” He also said the talks would continue in the coming days on 
the Polish-Belarusian border.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Western
 officials believe Putin wants to overthrow Ukraine’s government and 
replace it with a compliant regime, reviving Moscow’s Cold War-era 
influence. His comments have raised fears that the invasion of Ukraine 
could lead to nuclear war, whether by design or mistake.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">On
 Monday afternoon, Macron spoke by phone with Putin for 90 minutes, 
according to the French presidency. It said Putin expressed his “will to
 commit” to stopping all strikes against civilians and residential areas
 and to preserving civilian facilities. Macron asked him to end the 
military offensive in Ukraine and reaffirmed the need for an “immediate 
cease-fire.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">DOES UKRAINE WANT TO JOIN THE EUROPEAN UNION?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">In
 a move sure to antagonize the Kremlin, Zelenskyy signed an application 
Monday asking that Ukraine be allowed to join the 27-nation European 
Union. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">He posted
 photos online of himself signing the application, and his office said 
the paperwork was on its way to Brussels, where the EU is headquartered.
 The move was largely symbolic, as Ukraine is very far from reaching the
 EU’s membership standards, and the bloc is expansion-weary and unlikely
 to take on new members anytime soon.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">WHAT’S GOING ON WITH THE UNITED NATIONS?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The U.N.’s two major bodies — the 193-nation General Assembly and the more powerful 15-member Security Council — were holding <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-united-nations-general-assembly-emmanuel-macron-europe-charters-00dd164ce18fcd32936d9fe5021eef1f">separate meetings </a><!-- --> Monday to discuss the war.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The
 council meeting opened with the news that the United States was kicking
 out 12 Russian U.N. diplomats whom Washington accuses of spying. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Meanwhile,
 the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor said he plans to 
open an investigation “as rapidly as possible” into possible war crimes 
and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. Prosecutor Karim Khan said the 
investigation will look at alleged crimes committed before the Russian 
invasion, but that he also intends to look into any new crimes that 
either side might have committed since the invasion started.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE FLED UKRAINE?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">U.N.
 High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, speaking by video to the
 U.N. Security Council, said more than 520,000 refugees had fled Ukraine
 and that the number “has been rising exponentially, hour after hour.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The U.N. expects the total to reach 4 million in the coming weeks, he said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Earlier
 Monday, when the overall count still stood at around half a million, 
UNHCR spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo said the count included 281,000 in 
Poland, more than 84,500 in Hungary, about 36,400 in Moldova, over 
32,500 in Romania and about 30,000 in Slovakia. The rest were scattered 
in other countries, she said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT OF THE INVASION?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The Russian <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-business-japan-asia-a97accbad0c72f21bdbecb863ab33be5"> currency plunged</a><!-- -->
 about 30% against the U.S. dollar on Monday after Western nations moved
 to block some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system
 and to restrict Russia’s use of its massive foreign currency reserves. 
The ruble later recovered ground after swift action by Russia’s central 
bank. The Moscow stock exchange was closed all day. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The
 U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions targeting the Russian 
central bank and state investment funds. It said the move effectively 
immobilizes any assets of Russia’s central bank in the United States or 
held by Americans.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The
 EU on Monday officially slapped sanctions on 26 more Russians, 
including oligarchs, senior officials and an energy insurance company, 
bringing the total of people targeted to 680. EU sanctions also target 
53 Russian entities, which are usually organizations, agencies, banks or
 companies.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The 
president of neutral Switzerland said his country would adopt the EU’s 
sanctions targeting Russians, including asset freezes, all but depriving
 well-heeled Russians of access to one of their favorite safe havens to 
park money.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">In Russia, people have been <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-japan-9fbeb1c66c523f4018abb8ebc6580839">flocking to banks </a><!-- -->
 and ATMs for days, seeking to exchange rubles for dollars or euros, 
with reports on social media of long lines and machines running out.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Economists
 and analysts said a sharp devaluation of the ruble would mean a drop in
 the standard of living for the average Russian. Kremlin spokesman 
Dmitry Peskov described the new sanctions as “heavy,” but argued Monday 
that “Russia has the necessary potential to compensate the damage.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">WHAT ARE WORLD SPORTS BODIES DOING ABOUT RUSSIA?</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">World soccer body FIFA and European soccer authority UEFA on Monday <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-winter-sports-6ff8a6338e968bcb2ccb3c8dc368586d">banned Russian national and clubs teams</a><!-- -->
 from their competitions “until further notice.” Russia’s men’s national
 team had been scheduled to play in World Cup qualifying playoffs in 
just three weeks.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The
 high-level punishment involving sports and politics — not seen for 
decades — came after the International Olympic Committee pushed dozens 
of sports governing bodies to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes 
and officials from international events. The IOC said this was needed to
 “protect the integrity of global sports competitions and for the safety
 of all the participants.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Denying
 Russia a place on the international stage should deliver a financial 
and psychological blow to the country, along with tarnishing its image 
as an elite sports powerhouse.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Follow AP’s coverage of the tensions between Russia and Ukraine at <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p></div></div></div><div class="Component-footer-0-2-1 -footer"><div class="fluid-wrapper"><div class="Component-grid-0-2-2"><nav class="Component-nav-0-2-3"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">AP NEWS</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-news">Top Stories</a></li><li><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/videos">Video</a></li><li><a href="mailto:support@apnews.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="https://apnews.com/accessibility-statement">Accessibility Statement</a></li><li><button class="optanon-show-settings">Cookie Settings</button></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-apps-0-2-4"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Download AP NEWS</div><div class="Component-downloadDescription-0-2-11">Connect with the definitive source for global and local news</div><div class="Component-list-0-2-13"></div></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-moreFromAp-0-2-5"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">More from AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/">ap.org</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://insights.ap.org/">AP Insights</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.ap.org/">AP Definitive Source Blog</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://apimagesblog.com/">AP Images Spotlight</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/explore/">AP Explore</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/books/">AP Books</a></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-followAp-0-2-6"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Follow AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-17"><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/AP" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-twitter"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/APNews" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-facebook"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AssociatedPress" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-youtube"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/associated-press" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-linkedin"></use></svg></a></li></ol></nav><div class="Component-divider-0-2-7 Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><div class="Component-legalStuff-0-2-8 Component-legalStuff-0-2-20"><nav class="Component-legalStuffNav-0-2-21"><div class="Component-title-0-2-24 Component-spaceBelow-0-2-27">The Associated Press</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-22"><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/about/">About</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/contact-us/">Contact</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://aphelp.ap.org/">Customer Support</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/careers/">Careers</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a href="https://apnews.com/termsofservice">Terms &amp;
