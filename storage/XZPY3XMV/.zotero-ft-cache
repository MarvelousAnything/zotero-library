WASHINGTON — President Biden said on Friday that the United States had intelligence showing that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had made a final decision to invade Ukraine.

“We have reason to believe the Russian forces are planning to, intend to, attack Ukraine in the coming week, in the coming days,” Mr. Biden said in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. “We believe that they will target Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people.”

Asked whether he thought that Mr. Putin was still wavering, Mr. Biden said, “I’m convinced he’s made the decision.” Later he added that his impression of Mr. Putin’s intentions was based on U.S. intelligence.

Previously, the president and his top national security aides had said they did not know whether Mr. Putin had made a final decision to follow through with his threat of an invasion of Ukraine.

Still, Mr. Biden implored Russia to “choose diplomacy.”

“It is not too late to de-escalate and return to the negotiating table,” Mr. Biden said, referring to planned talks between Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Russia’s foreign minister next week. “If Russia takes military action before that day, it will be clear that they have slammed the door shut on diplomacy.”

Mr. Biden also underscored that the United States and its allies were united behind imposing severe economic sanctions if Russia’s forces cross Ukraine’s borders.

The president spoke after holding another round of virtual talks with European leaders on Friday afternoon.

Tensions in the region escalated as Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine called for a mass evacuation of the area on Friday, claiming that Ukraine government forces were about to attack. Western officials denounced that as Russia’s latest attempt to create a pretext for invasion.

Mr. Biden’s remarks follow a new assessment by American officials based in Europe that Russia has as many as 190,000 troops massed at the Ukrainian border and inside two pro-Moscow separatist regions, Donetsk and Luhansk.

Mr. Putin insisted on Friday that he was prepared for further diplomacy. But Russian officials said the country’s military would conduct drills over the weekend that would include the launch of ballistic and cruise missiles.

The prospect of testing the country’s nuclear forces added to the sense of foreboding in the region.

“We are ready to go on the negotiating track under the condition that all questions will be considered together, without being separated from Russia’s main proposals,” Mr. Putin said at a news conference.

KYIV, Ukraine — As fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine grew, the Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine called for the evacuation on Friday of every woman and child in the region, claiming that the Ukrainian military was about to launch a large-scale attack.

The head of Ukraine’s ministry of defense said the claim an attack was imminent was false, a ploy designed to inflame tensions and offer a pretext for Russia to invade. He made a direct appeal to people living in the region, telling them they were fellow Ukrainians and were under no threat from Kyiv.

The separatist leaders called for evacuation as state-controlled media in Russia released a steady stream of reports claiming the Ukrainian government was stepping up attacks on those breakaway regions — Donetsk and Luhansk.

The United States and its NATO allies have warned for days that Russia might use false reports out of eastern Ukraine about violence threatening ethnic Russians living there to justify an attack. The hyperbolic warnings from the separatists — who offered no proof of imminent danger — were greeted with a sense of urgency by the Ukrainian government.

The defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, urged Ukrainians in the separatist-held territories to ignore Russian propaganda that the Ukrainian government was going to attack them. “Don’t be afraid,” he said. “Ukraine is not your enemy.”

But Denis Pushilin, the pro-Moscow leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic, a secessionist state in Ukrainian territory, offered a starkly different version of what might be coming.

“Very soon, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky will order the military to go on an offensive, to implement a plan to invade the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics,” he said in a video posted online, offering no evidence.

“From today, Feb. 18, a mass organized transfer of the population to Russia is being organized,” he added. “Women, children, and the elderly will need to be evacuated first. We urge you to listen and make the right decision.” He noted that accommodation would be provided in Russia’s nearby Rostov region.

The leader of the separatists in Luhansk, Leonid Pasechnik, put out a similar statement on Friday urging people who are not in the military or “operating social and civilian infrastructure” to leave for Russia.

While Moscow and Kyiv have long offered wildly different narratives in the conflict, the call for some 700,000 people to flee the region and seek safety in Russia was a dramatic escalation. It remained unclear how many people were actually leaving the country.

Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has claimed that Ukraine is committing “genocide” in the eastern Donbas region and his ambassador to the United Nations has compared the government in Kyiv to Nazis.

On Friday night, reports of a major car bombing in the region and other attacks were broadcast across Russian state media. It was hard to independently verify the reports as access to Western journalists is severely restricted in the secessionist territory.

Social media was flooded with contradictory accounts and images that could not be immediately verified.

Some pictures posted online showed people lining up at cash machines, suggesting mass flight, while a Ukrainian official sent a video from what he said was a traffic camera in Donetsk, which did not show bus convoys or any signs of panic or evacuation.

Earlier in the day, Michael Carpenter, the U.S. ambassador for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, said that Russia was looking for a pretext to attack Ukraine and exploit the deep tensions in the eastern region of Donbas.

“Starting several weeks ago, we acquired information that the Russian government was planning to stage a fabricated attack by Ukrainian military or security forces against Russian sovereign territory, or against Russian-speaking people in separatist-controlled territory, to justify military action against Ukraine,” he wrote, adding that international observers should “beware of false claims of ‘genocide.’"

Putin has already weakened Ukraine’s economy.

KYIV, Ukraine — Without outright declaring war or taking action that would trigger the harsh sanctions promised by the West, Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, has once again succeeded in destabilizing Ukraine and making clear that Russia could wreck the country’s economy.

The evacuation announced last week of American, British and Canadian citizens has led to panic. Several international airlines have stopped flights into the country. Russian naval exercises in the Black Sea have exposed the vulnerability of Ukraine’s critical ports for commercial shipping.

And as for real estate?

“The number of requests is fewer and fewer every day,” said Pavlo Kaliuk, a freelance property broker in Ukraine’s capital, who used to sell and rent properties to clients from the United States, France, Germany and Israel. In November, when Russia first began posting troops along the country’s border, the deals quickly dried up.

The anxiety coursing through Kyiv is exactly what Mr. Putin hopes to achieve, according to Pavlo Kukhta, an adviser to Ukraine’s minister of energy. “What they want to do is the equivalent of winning the war without firing a single bullet, by causing massive panic here,” Mr. Kukhta said.

Timofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics and a former minister of economic development, said his institution has estimated that the crisis has already cost Ukraine “several billion dollars,” just in the past few weeks. War or a long siege would only worsen the situation.

The first major blow came Monday when two Ukrainian airlines said they were unable to acquire insurance for their flights, forcing Ukraine’s government to create a $592 million insurance fund to keep planes flying. On Feb. 11, London-based insurers had warned aviation companies that they would be unable to insure flights to Ukraine or those flying above its airspace. KLM Airlines, a Dutch company, responded by saying it would halt flights. Many Dutch passengers were onboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 when it was shot down above territory controlled by pro-Moscow rebels in 2014. The German airline Lufthansa said it was suspending flights to Kyiv and Odessa starting Monday.

But the American response to the crisis has also infuriated some people, whether by creating panic with alarmist warnings of an imminent invasion or the decision to evacuate some embassy staff from Kyiv and set up a temporary office in the western city of Lviv, close to the border with Poland.

“When someone decides to move the embassy to Lviv, they must understand that such news will cost the Ukrainian economy several hundred million dollars,” David Arakhamia, the leader of the governing Servant of the People’s Party, said in a television interview, adding: “Every day we count the losses of the economy. We can’t borrow in foreign markets because the rates there are crazy. Many exporters refuse us.”
Correction :  
Feb. 22, 2022

An earlier version of this post misidentified the airline whose plane was shot down above territory controlled by pro-Moscow rebels in 2014. It was a Malaysia Airlines plane, not a KLM one.

The U.S. says Russia’s troop buildup could be as high as 190,000 in and near Ukraine.

The United States said on Friday that Russia had likely amassed as many as 190,000 troops near the borders of Ukraine and inside the separatist regions in the country’s east, significantly raising its estimate of Moscow’s troop buildup as the Biden administration tries to persuade the world of the imminent threat of an invasion.

The assessment was delivered in a statement by the U.S. mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, calling it “the most significant military mobilization in Europe since the Second World War.”

“We assess that Russia probably has massed between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and near Ukraine as compared with about 100,000 on Jan. 30,” the statement read . “This estimate includes military troops along the border, in Belarus and in occupied Crimea; Russian National Guard and other internal security units deployed to these areas; and Russian-led forces in eastern Ukraine.”

Russia has characterized the troop buildup as part of routine military exercises, including joint drills with Belarus, a friendly nation that lies along Ukraine’s northern border, close to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Those drills, which involve Russian troops from hundreds of miles to the east, are scheduled to end on Sunday.

Moscow has also announced large-scale drills in Crimea, the peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and naval war games involving amphibious landing ships off Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, raising fears of a possible naval blockade.

The new U.S. assessment came after Ukraine called for an emergency meeting at the O.S.C.E., of which Russia is also a member, to demand Russia explain the buildup. The 57-nation body requires member states to provide prior warning of and information about certain military activities.

Russia has said the troop deployments do not meet the organization’s definition of “unusual and unscheduled military activities,” and has declined to provide answers.

U.S. estimates of Russia’s troop deployment have been rising steadily. In early January, Biden administration officials said that Russian forces numbered around 100,000. That figure grew to 130,000 in early February. Then, on Tuesday, President Biden put the number at 150,000 — with brigades typically based as far away as Siberia joining the force.

Allegations of a car bomb and unsubstantiated claims of an imminent attack by Ukrainian forces have heightened tensions in areas of Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists . The New York Times collected footage from the day to analyze some of the claims:

    Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine made unverified claims that Ukraine used an explosive to target the vehicle of one of their military leaders on Friday. Footage filmed at the scene by pro-Russian news media outlets shows the damaged vehicle in flames.

    Earlier on Friday, separatist leaders had warned of an imminent attack by Ukrainian forces — an allegation for which there is no evidence, and which Ukraine has denied.

    Civilians were urged to evacuate, captured on camera forming lines at gas stations and A.T.M.s and appearing to flee the region.

    Just after midnight on Saturday, verified footage showed another possible explosion, this time in Luhansk.

The U.S. will give Poland 250 tanks in a show of NATO unity.

The United States plans to provide Poland with 250 of its newest tanks, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said on Friday, in a show of support for a NATO ally as Russian forces menace Ukraine, Poland’s eastern neighbor.

The tanks, expected to arrive in Poland in 2025 at the earliest, would complement another move: the doubling of American troops on the ground to nearly 9,000.

“It will also strengthen our interoperability with the Polish armed forces, boosting the credibility of our combined deterrence efforts and those of other NATO allies,” Mr. Austin said, referring to the M1A2 tank . He was speaking at a news conference in Warsaw with Poland’s defense minister.

The United States warned on Thursday that fresh shelling in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists could herald an invasion by Russia after weeks of tension.

President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said this week that the country was moving some of its forces back from the border with Ukraine, but Mr. Austin said that the reverse appeared to be true. Russian troops were moving closer to the border, increasing their logistical capacity and dispersing their forces, he said.

“All of the indicators continue to indicate that he will maintain the capability to launch an attack most any time,” Mr. Austin said.

Mr. Putin has sought to weaken NATO, but the weeks of tension over Ukraine have had the opposite effect, said Mr. Austin, who met with NATO leaders in Brussels on Tuesday.

“What Mr. Putin did not want was a stronger NATO on his flank, and that is exactly what he has today,” he said.

The significance of Mr. Austin’s announcement was the strong message it sent to Mr. Putin, said Samantha de Debendern, an expert on Eastern Europe at Chatham House, a British think tank.

“It is basically saying: ‘Not only are we not going to do any of the things that you asked us to do, we are actually reinforcing NATO’s presence on its eastern front,’” she said, referring to demands by Mr. Putin that NATO pull back troops from countries such as Poland that joined the alliance since 1997.

Videos show reported explosions near Luhansk.

Two explosions were reported Friday near the city of Luhansk, capping off a volatile day in the pro-Moscow separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.

Multiple videos posted to the Telegram app showed what appeared to be a large, distant fire illuminating the night sky.

Several of the cellphone videos that recorded the scene were filmed around midnight, The New York Times confirmed. One video , filmed from an apartment building in Luhansk, showed the fire in the north of the city, in the direction of a gas pipeline and a gas compressor station.

Tatyana Bogorodko, the director general of Luganskgaz, a state-run local gas supplier, blamed the explosions on sabotage, according to pro-Russian news outlets, but she did not specify who she believed was responsible.

Other videos , filmed shortly after midnight on Saturday local time, showed damage to a pipeline. The cause of the damage was unclear.

As concerns grew in Europe over an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine, Germany’s foreign minister suggested for the first time on Friday that military action by Moscow could mean the end of Nord Stream 2, a natural-gas pipeline running from Russia to Germany.

“We in Germany are prepared to pay a high price economically. That’s why everything is on the table — also Nord Stream 2,” the minister, Annalena Baerbock, told the Munich Security Conference, the high-profile annual trans-Atlantic security gathering that is taking place from Friday to Sunday.

Ms. Baerbock’s comments departed from the German government’s public comments so far during the Ukraine crisis, which had refrained from explicitly mentioning the pipeline as part of a package of sanctions that Western countries would impose against Russia if it invades Ukraine. That has irked Germany’s allies, prompting some to question the resolve of Europe’s largest democracy to bear the cost of sanctions.

Nord Stream 2, which is not yet completed, is owned by Russia’s state-backed energy giant, Gazprom, and is a sign of Europe’s energy dependence on Russia .

It is one of the largest infrastructure projects underway in Europe today, a 746-mile pipeline stretching under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St. Petersburg to Germany. The project has gone ahead in the face of opposition from the United States and most European countries.

Russia has decided not to send an official delegation to the Munich Security Conference for the first time in 20 years, which some consider a worrisome sign.

The embattled Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is expected to arrive on Saturday to seek support and solidarity, even after President Biden said on Thursday that he thought the Russians might invade Ukraine in the next few days.

Russia denies any intention of invading Ukraine, and a conference devoted to diplomacy will no doubt chew over any possibility that, in Churchill’s phrase, “Jaw-jaw might forestall war-war,” at least for now.

The American delegation to the conference, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, will include Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken. Mr. Blinken arrived overnight and said that he expected to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, sometime late next week, as long as Russia did not attack Ukraine.

Two founding members of the Soviet Union — Russia and Ukraine — are once again at a flash point. Here are some pivotal moments leading to a Russian invasion that some fear could become the largest military action in Europe since World War II.

February 2014 — Protesters in Ukraine overthrow President Viktor Yanukovych, who was friendly to Russia’s interests. During the revolution, more than 100 people are killed in protests that centered on the main square in the capital Kyiv, often called the Maidan.

The interim government that followed this pro-Western revolution eventually signs a trade agreement with the European Union that is seen as a first step toward membership of the bloc.

April 2014 — Russia invades and then annexes the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Two secessionist regions, the Donetsk People’s Republic and the neighboring Luhansk People’s Republic, break off from Ukraine.

The war continues in the eastern Ukrainian region known as Donbas. It then spreads west. Roughly 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians eventually die in the conflict. The front lines have barely shifted for years.

2014 and 2015 — Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany sign a series of cease-fire agreements known as the Minsk Accords . Many view these accords as ambiguous.

April 2019 — A former comedian, Volodymyr Zelensky , is elected by a large majority as president of Ukraine on a promise to restore Donbas to the country.

2021-2022 — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia seeks to prevent Ukraine’s drift toward the United States and its allies. Mr. Putin demands “security guarantees,” including an assurance by NATO that Ukraine will never join the group and that the alliance pulls back troops stationed in countries that joined after 1997.

Many Russians view the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, as the birthplace of their nation and cite the numerous cultural ties between the two countries.

Here is a brief recap of their relations in the 20th century:

1922 — Russia and Ukraine became two of the founding members of the Soviet Union.

1932 and 1933 — A famine caused by Stalin’s policy of collectivization kills millions of people, mainly ethnic Ukrainians in a country that is known as the bread basket of the Soviet Union. The disaster is known as the Holodomor.

1941-1944 — Nazi Germany and the Axis powers occupy the country during World War II.

1991 — The Soviet Union is terminated via a treaty. Ukraine becomes independent and begins a transition to a market economy. It also comes into possession of a significant stockpile of nuclear weapons that had belonged to the Soviet Union.

1994 — Under the Budapest Memorandum , Ukraine gives up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for a commitment from Moscow “to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.”

On the ground: In eastern Ukraine, people know the price of war all too well.

As rockets whistled across the night sky over the front line in eastern Ukraine, Kostyantyn Reutsky, a humanitarian volunteer, said he had arrived in the town of Kondrashivka around 3 a.m. on Friday.

He was there to check on vulnerable people, including a couple, Oleksandr and Kateryna. A rocket shell hit their home on Thursday around 9 p.m. They did not sleep at all during the night, and still could not find rest amid the stress and cold.

“The roof of the house was destroyed almost completely,” he said.

The couple have nowhere to go, he said, and are now living in single room that was undamaged in the attack. They have strung up blankets at its entrance to try to keep the bitter wind from biting.

While many in the region have experienced sporadic shelling, Mr. Reutsky said there were no military facilities in this part of the village, and during all the years of the war, he was told, no shells had previously fallen there.

But the region bears the scars of years of conflict. When two schools were struck by shells on Thursday, they added to the tally of over 750 schools damaged since the conflict began in 2014, according to the U.N. children’s agency.

“Attacks on kindergartens and schools have been a sad reality for children in eastern Ukraine over the past eight years,” the agency, UNICEF, said in a statement on Friday.

Listen to ‘The Daily’: How Ukrainians View This Perilous Moment
A Russian invasion of the former Soviet state may be imminent. How will its citizens respond if it happens?

sabrina tavernise

    From The New York Times, I’m Sabrina Tavernise. This is The Daily.

    Today, U.S. officials say that Russia could invade Ukraine as early as this week. My colleague, Michael Schwartz, traveled through Ukraine to understand how Ukrainians are making sense of this perilous moment.

    It’s Tuesday, February 15.

    So Mike, you’ve been in Ukraine for a couple of weeks now. Tell me what it looks like. What does it feel like there right now?
michael schwartz

    I arrived in Kyiv at the beginning of January. And there’s all this noise about military buildup, and they’re planning for war. And you get there, and nothing is happening.

    The streets were quiet. There was no military vehicles on the street, no soldiers. People weren’t lined up at ATMs taking out money or stocking up on groceries. And as I do when I arrive in a new place for a story, I went out and took a walk around town. The one place you go when you arrive in Kyiv and you want to take the pulse of what is going on in the city is Independence Square, where everybody gathers anytime something big is going on in the country.

    And when I got there, it was fairly empty. But I took a walk up the hill behind the square. And I happened upon a small wooden chapel. And there is this black steel and granite monument with these kind of spectral faces taken from real life photos of individuals, with their names, their ages and the cities where they came from.

    And this is the monument to what Ukrainians call the Heavenly Hundred. These were individuals who were killed in a heavy shootout over several days in Kyiv in 2014 during an uprising that the Ukrainians have come to refer as the Revolution of Dignity.
sabrina tavernise

    And what is the Revolution of Dignity?
michael schwartz

    The Revolution of Dignity started actually in the fall of 2013. Ukraine was set to sign an association agreement with the European Union, a trade agreement that would have locked the country into a kind of Western course. But under pressure from Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president — the president of Ukraine at the time — backed out of the deal.

    And on its face, it seemed like a pretty minor thing. But Ukrainians took this to be a major betrayal by Ukraine’s Kremlin-backed government, and poured into the streets to express their displeasure in what became a months-long occupation of this square — Independence Square in Central Kyiv.

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    And so after months of protests in which these protesters refused to leave the square, in which the government is slowly losing its grip on the situation, the government ordered its riot police forces to open fire on the crowd in an effort to disperse them, killing 100-plus people.

    And this was really an inflection point in Ukraine’s history. Because shortly after this, the protesters were able to drive the Kremlin-backed government out of Kyiv and install a new government. And this was a point that Ukrainians look back on with a great deal of pride, that they were able to — through the force of numbers, through the force of their own will — overturn what seemed to be an inevitability, that Moscow would continue to have a say over the affairs of the country. They were able to stand up and put a stop to it at the cost of these 100 lives.
sabrina tavernise

    Oh, wow.
michael schwartz

    So this memorial’s become a pilgrimage site for people all around Ukraine. And as I came up to inspect this memorial, there were two elderly women there in headscarves, cleaning up the site.

michael schwartz

    [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

michael schwartz

    And I approached them and asked them to describe what it is that the memorial stood for. And one of them turned to me and said, well, this is a memorial for the heroes of Ukraine.

speaker

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
michael schwartz

    What she’s saying is that every time one of the individuals who died during the uprising in 2014 has a birthday, she hangs their photos on a little holder here and rings a bell.

sabrina tavernise

    Hmm. So Mike, it sounds like this is very much a wound that’s still alive, that this was a real moment in Ukrainian society. Like, it changed something.
michael schwartz

    I think it changed everything. It was such a shock for people to witness their own government firing on children and elderly people, and their own citizens, these people who came out to express their dissatisfaction. It was such a shock to them that Russia could be behind this, that Russia would be supportive of this action.

    And it is really — as you said, it has really scarred people. And it has changed the way they think about their country. It has changed the way they think about themselves.

michael schwartz

    [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

michael schwartz

    So I had an encounter with a young woman on Independence Square, where I started speaking to her in Russian. And she looked at me quizzically, even, and started speaking to me in Ukrainian. And when I conveyed to her that I couldn’t understand what she’s saying —

speaker

    I’m Ukrainian. However, you can — our language is Ukrainian. So how am I supposed to speak Russian?

michael schwartz

    — and said, you know, I’m a Ukrainian citizen. I’m in my own country. I’m going to speak Ukrainian, not Russian.

speaker

    And especially now, it’s a war between two countries. And at least what I can do is to show that I respect my country through language.

sabrina tavernise

    So Mike, you’re describing this real kind of turn away from Russian language and kind of Russianness. Did that surprise you?
michael schwartz

    It didn’t surprise me. And that’s because this is Kyiv. Kiev’s a cosmopolitan place.

    And you’d expect people to be more Western-oriented. People are wealthier, they travel more, and so they feel the pull of Western culture. But you know, I’ve covered this part of the world for 20-some years now. And everybody knows that Ukraine is more complicated than that, that there’s a push and a pull in Ukraine between Russia on one side and the West on the other.

    There are those who consider themselves Western, those who consider themselves strongly Russian. And this is a defining feature of the country. And it has been a defining feature of the country since the Soviet collapse in 1991.

    So this is weighing on my mind as I think about the possible scenarios for a Russian attack on Ukraine. We know what Putin is after. He wants to return Ukraine to what he considers Russia’s sphere of influence.

    We know that the West is not willing to come to Ukraine’s rescue in this case. They’re not willing to send troops. But the big mystery at this moment is how the Ukrainians are going to respond, and what they’re going to do should an attack come. Are they going to rise up and mount some kind of resistance? Are they going to throw up their hands and accept that they will never leave Russia’s orbit?

    And so in order to get a better sense of where Ukrainians are at, I set out from Kyiv into a part of the country that is — typically leans more Russian to get a better sense of how they’re feeling about this current moment, in which some are saying that Ukraine is facing perhaps its greatest peril in decades.

    And where did you go?
michael schwartz

    I rented a car in Kyiv with a photographer, Brendan Hoffman. And we decided to drive south. And once you get outside Kyiv, the land quickly opens up into these fallow, brown-green sunflower fields that stretch along for miles and miles.

    And one of the towns we stopped in was called Dnipro. And this is an important city. In 2014, after these protests toppled the government in Kyiv, Vladimir Putin struck back. He annexed the Crimean Peninsula, and he also instigated a separatist war in a region in Eastern Ukraine called the Donbas.

michael schwartz

    This basically cleaved a small chunk of Eastern Ukraine off. It was occupied by these Russian-backed separatists. And the town of Dnipro, it’s about 150 miles away from the epicenter of the fighting. And it is a place where injured soldiers are brought to receive treatment when they suffer wounds on the front. And so the city plays an important role, and very likely stands to be affected in a major way by any military action that might occur.

sabrina tavernise

    And so who did you meet in Dnipro?
michael schwartz

    Well, I visited a hospital for the rehabilitation of military veterans.

michael schwartz

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
alexander

    Alexander.
michael schwartz

    Alexander.

michael schwartz

    There, I met a retired Sergeant named Alexander. And he told me this story about how he began the fight in the war in 2014 in the east, and how traumatic that was for him. But as we talked, he made a very interesting revelation —

alexander

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
michael schwartz

    Mm-hmm.
alexander

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    — that he was born in Russia.
sabrina tavernise

    OK, so Alexander’s born in Russia, becomes a Ukrainian soldier and then fights against Russian-backed separatists in 2014.
michael schwartz

    That’s right. And all the while, he has family members in Russia. And he describes this moment in 2014 when he called an aunt that’s still living in Russia to check on how she’s doing.

alexander

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    And almost immediately, he said, she starts to curse at him, asking him who he thought he was, some kind of Ukrainian rebel? And she yells at him, tells him not to call her anymore, accuses him of killing Russians in the street.

alexander

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    He tried to convince her that this wasn’t true, but she wouldn’t change her mind. And that was a break in their relationship. He said that after that, they stopped talking to one another.

alexander

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    And this was painful for him because at the time that she was accusing him of killing Russians in the street, these accusations sort of mirrored the Kremlin propaganda at the time. But what was in his head, he said, was the memory of Ukrainians who were being killed. And he sort of drifted into this reverie.

alexander

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    And he told a story of a 22-year-old soldier. It’s 2014, the war is going on. And he describes seeing this soldier at breakfast, and saying hello to him. And by lunchtime, he learns that this 22-year-old soldier, who has a young wife who’s pregnant and a small child, had been killed in the battle that morning.

alexander

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    And he says it’s something that he can never forget. But more importantly, he says, it’s something he can never forgive.

michael schwartz

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
alexander

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

sabrina tavernise

    How did he describe the emotion of that journey — born in Russia, then fighting Russians, then fighting his own family, and then losing a friend?
michael schwartz

    He described it as incredibly painful. But what he said is that it forced him to make a decision about his identity. And what he chose — he chose Ukraine.

alexander

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    And when I asked him, with all of these troops on the border and the threat of war looming, whether he would fight again, he said yes.

michael schwartz

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    He had this metaphor to describe it. He said, if you had some giant neighbor who was constantly coming into your apartment and ordering you around, wouldn’t you try to throw him out?

michael schwartz

sabrina tavernise

    We’ll be right back.

    So where did you go next?
michael schwartz

    I traveled across the Dnieper River to a steel mill that was built across the Dnieper River from downtown Dnipro.

speaker

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    And the interesting thing about this steel mill is that all the signs are in Russian.

michael schwartz

    I want to see all that stuff get melted.
speaker

    I know!

michael schwartz

    And this is one of the larger steel factories in Ukraine, and sort of the pride of Dnipro.
sabrina tavernise

    Huh.

speaker

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

sabrina tavernise

    And Mike, what’s the story of this factory?
michael schwartz

    So the factory was opened in 2012. And at that time, not just the factory, but all of Ukraine was hugely dependent on Russia as a market for Ukrainian goods. And the opening of this factory was not just a Ukrainian success story, it was a Russian success story —

    so much so that the director of the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, a close personal friend of Vladimir Putin, gave a concert at the opening.
sabrina tavernise

    Oh, wow. So this kind of iconic Russian ballet director gave a concert at the factory?
michael schwartz

    Right. And a large portion of its product was sold to Russia. 50 percent of its steel for railroad wheels went to Russia. And a good chunk of the steel piping that the factory produced also went to Russia. And this was just emblematic of how close the ties were between Ukraine and Russia.

    In 2014, the war begins. And again, this town, this factory is less than 150 miles away from the front. And the border is sealed, and the business dries up. All of the business that this factory had with Russia comes to an end. In 2014, the company sold nothing to Russia.
sabrina tavernise

    So it sounds like this is an example of another break — I mean, another change inside Ukraine. This one is economic, not emotional or familial. But you know, nevertheless, it’s like 2014 just flipped a switch for this factory. And now its business is really Europe-facing and no longer Russian-facing.
michael schwartz

    Right, they had to completely change their business model. They had to enhance the quality of their goods and make colossal investments in the factory in order to raise their standards to sell in European markets, in North American markets.

    I spoke to the press woman, who described 2014 as a trauma, but one that nudged Ukrainian businesses to find other ways to develop and improve themselves.

michael schwartz

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

sabrina tavernise

    Mike, where else did you go?

michael schwartz

    I’m here in Cherkasy, walking out onto what I hope is a mostly frozen Dnieper River to talk to some ice fishermen. So far, the ice appears to be holding.

    But it is certainly mushy.

michael schwartz

    I went to a town in Central Ukraine called Cherkasy, to a frozen part of the Dnieper River, where a number of men were out on the ice fishing.

michael schwartz

    I mean, there are definitely cracks in it.
speaker

    There are, here, for example.
michael schwartz

    Yeah, yeah. And there, for example.

michael schwartz

    And I walked out and tried to talk to some of them.

michael schwartz

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    But most of them dismissed my presence. And one of them cursed me out —

speaker

    [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

sabrina tavernise

    Oh, no!
michael schwartz

    — telling me that he’s a fisherman, and he doesn’t discuss politics.

speaker

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    But further out on the ice —

michael schwartz

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    — I met another man who was more talkative. And his name was Viktor Berkut.

viktor

    Viktor.
michael schwartz

    Viktor, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
viktor

    Berkut!

michael schwartz

    And he’s out there with his fishing rod, dressed head to toe in camouflage. An elderly man of 71 who comes alone, and spends his days when he can out on the ice, fishing. And we get to talking. And I find out that in fact, he was in the Red Army —
sabrina tavernise

    Oh, wow.
michael schwartz

    — for 28 years, and served all over the Soviet Union, from the far, far east of Russia to Siberia, up north in Belarus. So this is a man that was very much a Soviet born and Soviet by tradition. And so I’m thinking, this is going to be a guy who thinks that Ukraine, which had been joined to Russia in the Soviet Union for decades, that this is going to be a guy who wants Ukraine to remain within Russia’s orbit, even though it’s independent.
sabrina tavernise

    Like, you’d very much expect that he would have a pro-Russian view.
michael schwartz

    Right, right. And these are the type of people that do have pro-Russian views and nostalgia for their Soviet youth. And so I ask him about the current situation, about the troops amassed on the border. And I nearly fell through the ice when he responded.

viktor

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

sabrina tavernise

    Why? What did he say?
michael schwartz

    He said that Ukraine should join NATO, a Western military alliance that was set up for the purpose of countering the Soviet military that he was a part of for 30 years. And he said that Ukraine has chosen not a Russian direction, but a European direction. And —

viktor

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    — he starts badmouthing Russia. He says that Russia believes itself to be a country chosen by God, and almost talks about as if Russia needs to be put in its place. And that if Russia were to attack Ukraine, he said, he was almost certain of the Ukrainian response, which would be to stand and fight.

viktor

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

sabrina tavernise

    And what did you make of all of this — I mean, what Viktor Berkut was telling you?
michael schwartz

    It’s astonishing. The fact that this man could, late in his life, become Ukrainianized — to see himself as a Ukrainian patriot as opposed to a Soviet man, a man who grew up in the Soviet Union and served in the military, which was such a source of pride for millions of people — it’s really, really jarring. And to me, what this showed was that Putin was perhaps making a very real miscalculation.
sabrina tavernise

    What do you mean?
michael schwartz

    Well, no one really knows what Putin believes in his heart. But he, over the summer, published an essay in which he explained his thoughts on Ukraine. And it was a very long history of the ties linking Ukrainians and Russians.

    And the essence was essentially that Ukrainians and Russians were one people. They are of the same cultural, religious and linguistic background, and that they belong together. And he went even further to say that an independent Ukraine without Russia couldn’t exist, and accused the current government of somehow being poisoned by Western interlopers who had come in and lured them away from what was right and true in their country.

    And after all of these interviews that I’ve conducted on this trip through Ukraine, the one thing that is clear to me is that Ukrainians have changed. And I don’t know that Putin has sensed this. And in many ways, the start of that miscalculation by Putin goes back to 2014. And it forced them to think differently about themselves, to think of themselves as Ukrainian, not as part of this broader Slavic, Russified world that Putin likes to think exists, or says he thinks exists. They started to think of themselves as something different.
sabrina tavernise

    So in some ways, unwittingly, in trying to grasp Ukraine closer to Russia, Putin has in fact forged a national identity where before, there was some ambivalence. He’s accomplished precisely the thing that he set out not to.
michael schwartz

    Right, the exact opposite of what he set out to do. He had hoped to wrench Ukraine back into the Russian world, into Russia’s orbit. And in fact, he’s pushed it further away than it’s ever been.

    You know, I keep thinking about all these towns that I visited over the years. And when you used to drive around Ukraine, every town had its Lenin statue, and its hammer and sickles engraved into government buildings. And when you travel around Ukraine now, you don’t see that anymore.

    All of that has been toppled. The Lenins are gone. The hammers and sickles are gone.

    And what they’ve been replaced by are these memorials to the Heavenly Hundred protesters who were killed in 2014, and war memorials to soldiers who were killed in the battles against Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. And in many ways, this war, this conflict that Putin began in 2014 has allowed them to make their final break with their Soviet past.

    And when I’m thinking about the troops on the border, the threat of war that is now hanging over this country, I’ve been asking people what they’d be willing to give up in order to save themselves from the war, to spare perhaps tens of thousands of lives. What are they willing to give up for Ukraine? Would they give up half of Ukraine? Would they give up additional territory? Would they give up the lands in the south, the border on the Black Sea?

    And I get the same answer all the time. Do you think that Putin is going to stop at the Dnieper River? Do you think he’s going to stop with central Ukraine?

    And I asked this question of Viktor, the ice fisherman. And he responded with a metaphor.

viktor

    [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael schwartz

    He said that if you stretch out your hand to Russia, they will take the whole arm.

michael and victor

    [INTERPOSING VOICES]

sabrina tavernise

    So Mike, this stronger Ukrainian identity you’re talking about, what does it mean for the current situation? Does it mean that if Russia invades, Ukrainians will definitely fight? I mean, the people you spoke to are saying that they will, right?

    But I guess I’m thinking of the situation in Afghanistan in which, you know, suddenly, you had the government fleeing the country, and the army giving up. And a whole other power just occupied the place, really without a fight. And Ukraine, in some ways, has some similarities, right? Exhausted by wars over decades, and really, generations. And also kind of practical, and sandwiched in-between a giant power to the east and the West that really opposes that power.

    So what do you expect to happen? And what does this real shift in attitudes tell us about what might happen?
michael schwartz

    I think that’s fundamentally what the question is now. And it’s really hard to know. Because as soon as tanks start rolling through the streets and rockets start falling, people’s brains get scrambled.

    One thing that we do know, though, is that in 2014, when Ukraine came under attack the first time by a separatist movement provoked by the Kremlin, the Ukrainian military fell apart. It was nonexistent. And the only reason Ukraine didn’t lose more territory is that you had these college students and history professors, and people all over the country who joined up in these volunteer brigades that were equipped by companies like the steel factory I visited in Dnipro, and really rose up to fight against these separatists, and forced Russia to send in regular troops and equipment to push them back.

    Half the country could have been lost if these volunteer brigades didn’t appear almost overnight. And as I traveled around the country, everybody that I talked to said they would fight. The veterans who were in rehabilitation in the hospital said they would pick up arms again and fight. Students that I talked to said they would fight. People who had lives and children and futures said they would pick up their arms and fight.

    And Putin does not fully understand who the Ukrainian people have become.

    So if Putin decides to invade Ukraine under this assumption that Ukrainians are just like Russians, and will just accept it and capitulate, he could be sorely mistaken.
sabrina tavernise

    Mike, thank you.
michael schwartz

    You’re welcome.

    On Monday, the U.S. State Department announced it would relocate its remaining embassy staff in Ukraine from the capital, Kyiv, to Lviv, a city in the western part of the country. Secretary of State Antony Blinken cited the, quote, “dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces.”

    We’ll be right back.

    Here’s what else you need to know today.

    After discussing with cabinet and caucus, after consultation with premiers from all provinces and territories, after speaking with opposition leaders, the federal government has invoked the Emergencies Act to supplement provincial and territorial capacity to address the blockades and occupations.

sabrina tavernise

    Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, declared a national public emergency on Monday, a rare step that was part of an effort to end protests that have paralyzed Canada’s capital. The move was the most aggressive by authorities since the crisis began more than two weeks ago, and would allow the federal government to expand measures to reopen blocked border crossings and clear the blockade of about 400 trucks in Ottawa.

    I want to be very clear. The scope of these measures will be time limited, geographically targeted, as well as reasonable and proportionate to the threats they are meant to address.

    On Sunday, authorities managed to reopen a critical bridge between Ontario and Detroit by arresting demonstrators and towing trucks. And Donald Trump’s longtime accounting firm cut ties with him and his family business, saying that it could no longer stand behind annual financial statements it prepared for Trump. The firm told the Trump organization to essentially retract statements from 2011 to 2020, and to notify anyone who would receive the statements that they should no longer rely on them. Trump used the statements to secure loans, which are at the center of two investigations into whether Trump exaggerated the values of his properties.

Russia warns of a ‘military-technical’ solution to Ukraine. What does that mean?

For weeks, as Russian troops streamed from across their vast nation to take up positions threatening Ukraine from three directions, the clearest public warning spoken by President Vladimir V. Putin came on Dec. 21.

If the West refused to accede to his sweeping demands to renegotiate the security architecture of Eastern Europe, Mr. Putin said, Russia would “take appropriate military-technical reciprocal measures and will have a tough response to their unfriendly steps.”

The phrase was repeated in a lengthy letter that Moscow sent to Washington and published on Thursday, which said that unless the United States agreed to its security demands, Russia would respond by implementing “measures of a military-technical character.”

Which raises a question: What are military-technical measures?

The phrase has a long history — even if its current usage is shrouded in the fog of the Kremlin’s opaque information campaign .

The idea of a “military-technical revolution” comes from Russian military writings of the 1980s, according to a study from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, an independent research institute in Washington that focuses on military planning.

The term was widely used in the former Soviet Union not only to describe likely future developments in military techniques, but also to identify earlier eras when fundamental transformations of warfare had taken place.

In the current context, it is harder to divine what exactly Mr. Putin is signaling with the phrase.

Asked last month what Russia meant by military-technical means, the foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, described them as weapons deployments.

Russian analysts have speculated that it could involve the deployment of modern Russian missiles that directly threaten the West — perhaps even in Latin America or on submarines off the American mainland. But the Kremlin has been deliberately vague.

“When we make decisions on this or that step, we always understand what we mean and what we are preparing for,” Mr. Lavrov said at a news conference on Jan. 14.

Greg Austin, who leads the Cyber, Space and Future Conflict Program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, noted that Mr. Putin had made a distinction between “military” and “military-technical” during his Dec. 21 speech.

In an essay published this month , Mr. Austin wrote that “military-technical” could suggest actions that Russia could take without invading Ukraine. That, he wrote, includes possibilities like staging a naval blockade of the Ukrainian coast, enforcing a no-fly zone over parts of Ukraine, bombing Ukrainian weapons or missile-launch sites, or waging cyberattacks against Ukraine’s electric grid or other critical infrastructure.

In some of these cases, Mr. Austin wrote, Russia might cite similar measures taken by Western countries, such as no-fly zones enforced by the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and Syria, or NATO’s bombings of Kosovo and Yugoslavia in 1999.

But Mr. Austin, like other observers who have tried to parse Mr. Putin’s use of the term, acknowledged that only one person knows what it means in this case: Mr. Putin himself.

Analysis: Trying to discern whether Putin is a crafty strategist or reckless leader.

At this moment of crescendo for the Ukraine crisis, it all comes down to what kind of leader President Vladimir V. Putin is.

In Moscow, many analysts remain convinced that the Russian president is essentially rational, and that the risks of invading Ukraine would be so great that his huge troop buildup makes sense only as a very convincing bluff.

But some also leave the door open to the idea that he has fundamentally changed amid the pandemic, a shift that may have left him more paranoid, more aggrieved and more reckless.

A large-scale invasion of Ukraine, many analysts point out, would be an enormous escalation compared with any of the actions that Mr. Putin has taken before. In 2014, the Kremlin’s subterfuge allowed Russian forces stripped of identifying markings to capture Crimea without firing a single shot. The proxy war that Mr. Putin fomented in Ukraine’s east allowed him to deny being a party to the conflict.

“Starting a full-scale war is completely not in Putin’s interest,” said Anastasia Likhacheva, the dean of world economy and international affairs at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. “It is very difficult for me to find any rational explanation for a desire to carry out such a campaign.”

At home, Mr. Putin has always been keen to project the aura of a sober statesman, overruling the nationalist firebrands on prime-time talk shows and in Parliament who have been urging him for years to annex more of Ukraine.

And while he casts himself as Russia’s guarantor of stability, he could face stark economic headwinds from Western sanctions and social upheaval if there are casualties on the battlefield and among civilians.

Satellite images show Russian missiles on alert.

In recent days, researchers have seen the Russians put their surface-to-air missiles on alert.

Normally the missile canisters are horizontal — an indication that they are not at the ready. But when they are ready to launch, they appear to point straight up into the air.

This is how the canisters at Dzhankoi airfield in Crimea appeared by Feb. 10. In an image taken by Capella Space’s Synthetic Aperture Radar on Thursday, the S-400s could be seen with their canisters in a firing position, ready to launch.

“Although the Russian government continues to state they are removing troops from the region, I do not believe Russia has relaxed its military posture,” said Steven De La Fuente, a researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. “These images show Russia’s military forces are still on alert and ready to attack.”

Imagery from commercial satellite companies has been one important source of information as tensions rise over Russia’s military buildup surrounding Ukraine. Unlike traditional overhead imagery, the Capella SAR satellites can monitor sites even when there is cloud cover, as has often been the case in recent weeks over Ukraine.

Other outside experts have also raised questions about Russia’s claims of a drawdown. An analysis written for Janes, the defense intelligence company, concluded that “there are no indicators that a large-scale drawdown has begun.”

Janes analyzed satellite imagery, social media posts and Russian government videos purporting to show tanks leaving the border areas. The videos were inconclusive, and appeared designed to confuse, said Thomas Bullock, a senior open-source intelligence analyst with Janes.

Janes said it has monitored the deployment of air defense systems, long-range artillery and army units moving to sites about 18 miles from Ukraine’s borders, and the deployment of transport and attack helicopters to a site 25 miles from the Ukraine border.

Multinationals in Ukraine are ready for a conflict but staying put.

Big American and European companies operating on the ground in Ukraine said Friday that they had contingency plans at the ready in case of a Russian invasion but so far had not ordered the relocation of employees.

Even as Western leaders turned up warnings that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia may order an attack on Ukraine, executives at the multinational companies, for the most part, don’t believe that Russian troops will actually follow through with a ground invasion, said Anna Derevyanko, the deputy director of the European Business Association.

“Companies have put in place contingency plans, but they do not believe something terrible is going to happen,” said Ms. Derevyanko, whose association includes Nestlé, BASF, ArcelorMittal, Bayer and over 1,000 European firms that employ more than two million people in Ukraine.

“If you ask business people, they believe that a physical invasion is a low-risk scenario,” she added. “There is no sense of panic.”

The prospect of cyberattacks , on the other hand, is more worrisome. Government websites, state-owned banks and parts of the nation’s infrastructure have battled online invasions by hackers, believed by Ukrainians to be Russians, looking to disable computers and steal data. European and American companies in Ukraine see digital attacks as one of the major threats they must deal with and have moved to strengthen their cybersecurity, Ms. Derevyanko said.

The IT Ukraine Association, which includes local and international tech companies, such as Sigma Software and the video game giant Ubisoft, said that the industry’s presence in the country had grown steadily since Russia’s devastating invasion of Crimea in 2014.

Companies in the tech industry, now worth $6.8 billion, have plans to ensure the security and safety of their employees in the event of “emergencies” as part of their business strategy, the association said in a statement.

“The Armed Forces of Ukraine have accumulated strength, gained combat experience and is ready to defend the country and its population,” the statement continued. In turn, it said, tech companies’ response plans “are aimed at protecting talent and their business processes continuity.”

More than 90 percent of the tech companies surveyed this month assessed the risk of an escalation of the conflict as low to medium, the association added, noting that none had prepared for a full relocation.

The American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine said that its 633 members, which include 3M, Toyota and Citibank, continued to do business but had contingency plans to continue working in the event of an emergency.

Most of the member companies made their plans long ago but continue to update and review them, said Andy Hunder, president of the business association.

Ms. Derevyanko, of the European Business Association, said that Ukraine was counting on continued foreign investment to help keep the economy stable. Multinationals are located around the country in agribusiness, pharmaceuticals, technology and logistics.

Ukraine’s economy had only started to recover in recent years from a debilitating blow after Moscow in 2014 annexed Crimea, and pro-Russian rebels seized swathes of the eastern Donbas region in Ukraine. Since then, Western allies have seeded Ukraine and businesses operating there with over $48 billion in bilateral and multilateral economic support.

This week, the United States pledged to strengthen Ukraine’s economy, after a statement by the Group of 7 industrial nations promising to do the same.

“For now, companies are saying they plan to continue business as usual,” said Ms. Derevyanko. But the situation could yet grow complicated, especially if major seaports and airports are blocked, thwarting exports and dealing a further blow to the economy.

Counting Russian troops is an imprecise science.
Image

The United States now believes that Russia has as many as 190,000 troops in or near Ukraine, nearly twice as many as there were in January, according to an assessment made public on Friday by Michael Carpenter, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

That was a significantly higher number than the 150,000 troops President Biden referred to earlier this week, and the 100,000 in January.

But American officials said the new number includes some forces that were not previously counted — most notably Russian forces in Crimea, as well as separatist forces led by Russian military officers in the Donbas region, a portion of eastern Ukraine they have controlled since 2014. The officials did not provide a breakdown of these forces.

The new number also includes some additional forces that have moved into Belarus, according to American officials briefed on the intelligence. And the combat forces have increased, according to a defense official. There are now between 120 and 125 battalion tactical groups, up from 83 earlier in February.

Counting Russian forces is an imprecise science. The size of Russian battalions can vary, depending on their role. And while Russia has taken fewer pains to hide the movement of troops in recent weeks, moving units during the day rather than at night, the United States has not detected all of Russia’s combat preparations, officials said.

Russia has also, according to outside analysts, blocked some means of monitoring Russian rail traffic, which had been used to count forces flowing to and from the Ukrainian border.

A U.S. defense official said that as many as 75,000 of the Russian forces outside of Ukraine were in combat formations, ready to mount a full-scale invasion in days.

U.S. and allied officials have been divided on whether Russia intends an invasion aimed at occupying a wide swathe of the country, or if it wants simply to solidify its control in the Donbas region. But the defense official said that within the Russian forces outside Ukraine’s borders are reservist units, the kinds of forces that would be tasked not with taking new territory but with conducting occupation operations. And even as Russia has made a show of pulling back some forces, it has pushed other forces closer to the border.

Thomas Bullock, a senior open-source intelligence analyst with Jane’s, said Russia had moved air defense systems, long-range artillery and army units to sites about 18 miles from Ukraine’s borders in recent days, particularly in the area where the borders of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia converge.

“It’s very difficult to hide at this stage because the world is watching and they are moving a lot of equipment in,” Mr. Bullock said.
