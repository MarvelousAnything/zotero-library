Russia Warns West Against Providing Air Support to Ukraine

Russia on Wednesday warned Western countries about providing air support to Ukraine, the day after Poland said it would make its Soviet-era MiG-29 combat jets available to the U.S. for potential handover to the Ukrainian military.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the use by Ukraine of airfields in other countries would be “a very undesirable and potentially dangerous scenario.”

On Tuesday, Poland surprised Washington saying it would hand over its MiGs to the U.S. at Ramstein air base in Germany, effectively leaving it to the U.S. to figure out how to get the planes to Ukraine.

The Pentagon said it wasn’t clear that there was a “substantive rationale” for having Polish jets intended for Ukraine at an American air base, saying such a proposal raised concerns for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Russia's defense ministry on Sunday warned that countries offering airfields to Ukraine for attacks against Russian forces could be viewed as combatants in the conflict, according to state news agency TASS.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also has called for Western countries to impose a no-fly zone over the country to stop Russian helicopters and combat planes from attacking cities and people. NATO has rejected requests for a no-fly zone, saying it would risk war with Russia—an outcome that Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened if any NATO members enter the conflict.
