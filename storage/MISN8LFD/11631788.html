 Ukraine -- Buses carried civilians out of an embattled Ukrainian city 
Tuesday along a safe corridor agreed to by the two warring sides, while a
 parallel effort to relieve the besieged port of Mariupol was thrown 
into jeopardy by reports of renewed Russian shelling.<br><br>Europe's 
worst refugee crisis since World War II grew even more severe, with U.N.
 officials reporting that 2 million people have now fled Ukraine.<br><div class="adRectangle-pos-small-inline" data-set="adAppend"></div><br>Moscow's
 forces have laid siege to Ukrainian cities and cut off food, water, 
heat and medicine in a growing humanitarian disaster. But for days, 
attempts to create corridors to safely evacuate civilians have stumbled 
amid continuing fighting and objections to the proposed routes.<br><br>On
 Tuesday, a convoy of buses packed with people fleeing the fighting 
moved along a snowy road from Sumy, a northeastern city of a 
quarter-million people, according to video from the Ukrainian 
communications agency. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk 
said they were headed southwest to the Ukrainian city of Poltava, and 
included students from India and China.<br><br><b>WATCH: Former Ukraine first lady on why Ukrainians will not give up fight</b><br><div class="shortcode-container"><div class="shortcode-video"><div itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="name" content="Former first lady Kateryna Yushchenko on why Ukraine will not back down"><meta itemprop="description" content="Former Ukrainian first lady Kateryna Yushchenko is certain the people of Ukraine will not back down and give up in the face of Russian invasion and war."><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/11630480_030722-wls-iteam-goudie-ukraine-former-1st-lady-interview-6p-vid.jpg"><meta itemprop="contentURL" content="https://content.uplynk.com/ext/aac37e2c66614e699fb189ab391084ff/030722-wls-iteam-goudie-ukraine-former-1st-lady-interview-6p-vid.m3u8?ad._v=2&amp;ad.preroll=1&amp;ad.fill_slate=1&amp;ad.ametr=1&amp;rays=ihgfedc"><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2022-03-08T01:15:28Z"><div class="video-player-default"><div class="otv-vpaid"><div class="vpaid-content"></div><video class="vpaid-video"></video></div><div class="video-poster" data-autostart="false" data-rsid="wdgotvkabcresponsive,wdgotvsecondaryresponsive" data-pagename="politics/post_playlist/people-flee-embattled-ukrainian-cities-along-safe-corridors=11631788" data-topic="ukraine" data-contenttype="post" data-channel="misc" data-content-id="11631788" data-display-date="1646738040" data-adunit="/kabc/abc7.com/web/politics" data-tag="nato,vladimir-putin,russia,war,ukraine,us-world,politics" data-url="https://content.uplynk.com/ext/aac37e2c66614e699fb189ab391084ff/030722-wls-iteam-goudie-ukraine-former-1st-lady-interview-6p-vid.m3u8?ad._v=2&amp;ad.preroll=1&amp;ad.fill_slate=1&amp;ad.ametr=1&amp;rays=ihgfedc" data-islive="false" data-isclone="false" data-imgsrc="https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/11630480_030722-wls-iteam-goudie-ukraine-former-1st-lady-interview-6p-vid.jpg" data-dynamic="https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/11630480_030722-wls-iteam-goudie-ukraine-former-1st-lady-interview-6p-vid.jpg" data-imgalt="" data-video-id="11630481" data-station="kabc" data-headline="Former first lady Kateryna Yushchenko on why Ukraine will not back down" data-caption="Former Ukrainian first lady Kateryna Yushchenko is certain the people of Ukraine will not back down and give up in the face of Russian invasion and war."></div></div></div><div class="meta image-caption global-caption"><a class="button button-block embed-btn" href="#">EMBED </a><a class="button button-block" href="https://abc7.com/video/">More News Videos<div class="arrow-blue arrow-pos-right"></div></a><div class="embed-code"><textarea class="textarea" onclick="this.focus();this.select()">&lt;iframe

 battle for Mariupol is crucial because its capture could allow Moscow 
to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine
 in 2014.<br><br>Oleksiy Kuleba, governor of the Kyiv region, said Ukraine was also making arrangements to get people out of the suburb of Irpin.<br><br>Late
 Tuesday, Zelenskyy released a video showing him standing near the 
presidential offices in Kyiv. Behind him were piles of sandbags, a 
snow-dusted fir tree and a few cars.<br><br>It was the second video in 
24 hours showing him near the country's seat of power, apparently made 
to dispel any doubts about whether he had fled the city.<br><br>"Snow 
fell. It's that kind of springtime," he said in a soft voice. "You see, 
it's that kind of wartime, that kind of springtime. Harsh. But we will 
win."<br><br><i>Associated Press reporters from around the world contributed to this report.</i> <div class="report-typo">
