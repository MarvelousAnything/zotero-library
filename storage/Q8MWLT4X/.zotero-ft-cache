International pariah

Each day brings more economic punishments for Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. The sudden isolation of the Russian economy is striking in its speed and scope.

Yesterday, President Biden banned U.S. imports of Russian oil; Britain said it would phase out Russian oil imports by year end; and the E.U. pledged to shun Russian energy “ well before 2030 .” Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, said yesterday that it would stop buying Russian crude , after facing criticism for buying a tanker’s worth days earlier. Such unilateral corporate moves have compounded governments’ actions, cleaving Russia from the global economy , with uncertain and unpredictable consequences.

“Defending freedom is going to cost,” Biden said in announcing the import ban. Russia accounts for about 10 percent of the world’s oil supply, so any disruptions are likely to push up prices. Crude oil, which at around $125 a barrel is double its prepandemic level, could rise as high as $175, according to Goldman Sachs. The U.S. national average price of gasoline sits at $4.25 per gallon , a record. That is contributing to inflation and eating into consumers’ budgets, which could slow the U.S. economy (and hit countries that rely on Russian energy even harder).

    The effect of the embargoes and sanctions are clearer for the Russian economy, which S&P estimates will shrink by nearly 9 percent this year. Fitch said Russia is at risk of “imminent” default after cutting the country’s credit rating deeper into junk territory. President Vladimir Putin has ordered restrictions on Russian exports of unspecified raw materials, which will further limit the country’s trade revenues.

Replacing Russian oil won’t be easy , as the U.S. and other buyers chase limited supplies . Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait could add 2.5 million barrels, but all are all members of OPEC Plus, an alliance of oil-producing nations that includes Russia. Venezuela and Iran could contribute about 1.5 million barrels a day, but that would require lifting American sanctions. U.S. producers could also ramp up production, but it would take investment and time.

American brands quitting Russia has more than symbolic significance. After years of cultivating the Russian market, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and PepsiCo were among the companies yesterday that announced a pause to their operations there . Since Soviet times, these firms came to symbolize the opening of Moscow to the West. Starbucks also said it would close all of its locations and Yum Brands said some of its KFC and Pizza Hut locations would suspend operations.

    Although these companies’ Russian operations account for single-digit percentages of group profits, their absence will be felt: McDonald’s, for example, employs 62,000 people in Russia. (The company said it would continue to pay salaries.) “It appears that much of the Russian populace knows little about the attack on Ukraine,” Louis Wells of Harvard Business School told DealBook. “If McDonald’s and Coca-Cola disappear along with Ikea and other foreign brands, people have to ask why.”

The pressure on companies to act is growing , from investors, employees and social media campaigns. The list of company actions compiled by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management, updated daily, is a focus for a variety of stakeholders, and a major point of discussion in the boardrooms of companies highlighted because they have yet to disclose their Russia plans.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING

Regulators reportedly examine options trading at Activision Blizzard. The Justice Department and the S.E.C. are looking into purchases that Barry Diller, Alexander von Furstenberg and David Geffen made in January, days before the video game maker agreed to sell itself to Microsoft, The Wall Street Journal reports. Diller denied that the men acted on inside information.

A Chinese nickel producer may face big trading losses. Tsingshan Holding Group is sitting on potentially billions in paper losses , after fears of supply shortages sent nickel prices skyrocketing, according to The Wall Street Journal. (Trading in the metal is suspended until at least Friday.) The price jump has hurt producers like Tsingshan that sold nickel contracts as part of their standard hedging strategies.

Elon Musk asks to end an S.E.C. settlement. Lawyers for the Tesla chief asked a judge to scrap a legal agreement that requires some of his business-related tweets to be vetted before posting. The rationale: The S.E.C.’s monitoring his tweets means “Mr. Musk’s freedom of expression is infringed.”

Broad mask mandates in the U.S. are over. Hawaii became the last state to announce an end to universal mask requirements, though they’ll still be required indoors at public schools. Relatedly, a C.D.C. study found that mask mandates appear to have helped protect children from the coronavirus.

Apple announces new stuff. At its product launch event yesterday, the tech giant unveiled an upgraded entry-level iPhone, a faster iPad Air and a new desktop. Apple also said it had the exclusive rights to air two Friday night M.L.B. games on Apple TV+.

The latest on the Russia-Ukraine war

    Chinese companies that defy U.S. sanctions on Russia could be cut off from crucial American components, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo warned.

    Amazon Web Services has blocked new customer sign-ups in Russia and Belarus; Instagram will label — and demote — content from Russian state-owned media; and eBay will remove items that express support for President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Relatedly, demand for VPN apps in Russia is surging to avoid internet restrictions.

    Xavier Rolet, the former chief of the London Stock Exchange who now sits on a Russian company’s board , argued for a lifting of sanctions .

    Western lenders are reportedly reviewing their ties to a telecom company linked to the Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman. Meanwhile, does this $700 million superyacht docked near Tuscany belong to an oligarch?

    Times Opinion’s Tom Friedman is worried about Putin’s endgame.

The Russia-Ukraine War and the Global Economy
Card 1 of 6

Rising concerns. Russia’s attack on Ukraine has started reverberating across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes  and spooking investors . The conflict could cause​​ dizzying spikes in prices for energy  and food, and severely affect various countries and industries .

The cost of energy. Oil prices already are the highest since 2014 , and they have jumped  as the conflict has escalated. Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, providing roughly one of every 10 barrels the global economy consumes .

Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills . Natural gas reserves are running low , and European leaders have accused Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, of reducing supplies to gain a political edge.

Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat  and, together with Ukraine, accounts for nearly a quarter of total global exports . In countries like Egypt  and Turkey, that flow of grain makes up more than 70 percent of wheat imports.

Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium , used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.

Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions  intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.

Biden takes a step toward regulating crypto

President Biden will sign an executive order today directing regulatory agencies to come up with a comprehensive and coordinated approach to the sprawling cryptocurrency industry. It is a recognition of crypto’s growing popularity and its potential to destabilize traditional money and markets. The order also calls for continued study of a U.S. central bank digital currency, or digital dollar.

The executive order is a response to the “explosive growth” in digital assets , according to the White House. “The rise in digital assets creates an opportunity to reinforce American leadership in the global financial system and at the technological frontier, but also has substantial implications for consumer protection, financial stability, national security and climate risk.” The order directs financial regulators to continue with work that began in earnest last year to understand crypto’s risks and opportunities. It is a step closer to a comprehensive policy approach, but is unlikely to result in new rules anytime soon.

The crypto industry welcomed the move , saying that it begins to address a lack of regulatory clarity for digital assets. “We’ve seen a complete lack of any strategic direction or thought from the federal government for years,” said Louis Lehot, a cryptocurrency expert at the law firm Foley & Lardner. “The fact that the U.S. president has something to say about crypto is meaningful,” said Kristin Smith of the Blockchain Association, a trade group.

    A premature publishing of a statement about the order last night (which was quickly unpublished) appeared to cause a rally in crypto prices : Bitcoin jumped more than 8 percent, and has held onto its gains after the details were formally announced this morning.

The order was not prompted by Russian sanctions , a spokesman told reporters, but comes amid concerns that Moscow could use crypto to evade punishment. Today’s move, rather, is an effort to establish a more comprehensive approach to regulating a fast-growing industry that is attracting ever more money to projects that can operate anonymously and defy traditional business definitions. A case in point: The Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, is a new kind of crypto company that claims, in a way, not to be a company at all. For a sense of the difficulty that regulators may have addressing the disruptive force of the crypto phenomenon, we recommend this deep dive on DAOs , by Eric Lipton and DealBook’s Ephrat Livni.
