MOSCOW — Even with Russian warships massing off Ukraine’s Black Sea coast and the United States warning that Russian ground forces are poised to strike Ukraine from multiple directions, Russia’s top diplomat said on Monday that the possibility of a diplomatic resolution to the crisis was “far from exhausted.”

Another hint of averting war came from Ukraine’s president, who said Monday that his country might have to abandon the possibility of joining NATO — a central Russian demand in a confrontation that threatens the largest military conflict in Europe since World War II.

Speaking in what appeared to be a carefully scripted televised meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov said that he supported continuing negotiations with the West on the “security guarantees” Russia has been demanding of the United States and NATO.

“I believe that our possibilities are far from exhausted,” Mr. Lavrov said, referring to Russia’s negotiations with the West. “I would propose continuing and intensifying them.”

Mr. Putin responded simply: “Good.”

The televised meeting was a signal that Russia might continue using the threat of an invasion of Ukraine to try to squeeze diplomatic concessions from the West, rather than resorting to immediate military action.

At the same time, the comments by President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying that perhaps the notion of NATO membership “is for us like a dream” suggested — however vaguely — that his country might make the kind of concessions it has staunchly resisted so far.

NATO stated in 2008 that it intended for Ukraine to join the alliance eventually, though that remains a remote prospect. Moscow has demanded that Ukraine never be allowed to join NATO and has also called for a rollback of NATO forces from across Eastern Europe.

On Monday, President Biden spoke by phone with Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain — the latest in a flurry of talks with allied leaders on the crisis. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Biden have been the most adamant among NATO chiefs that Russia should face punishing economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The two leaders “reviewed ongoing diplomatic and deterrence efforts,” and also “discussed efforts to reinforce the defensive posture on NATO’s eastern flank,” the White House said in a readout of the call.

The U.S. and NATO formally rejected those demands, but they proposed several areas — including nuclear arms control and limits on military exercises — where they were willing to negotiate.

But the Kremlin has yet to respond, leaving a vast chasm that diplomacy has so far failed to bridge.

Mr. Putin asked Mr. Lavrov whether he had prepared a draft response to the proposals that the United States and NATO submitted last month. Mr. Lavrov said he had indeed prepared a 10-page response, offering no details. A spokesman for Mr. Putin, Dmitri S. Peskov, said after the televised meeting that the Kremlin would announce when Russia submitted its response, and that Mr. Putin would decide whether to make it public.

Mr. Putin told his diplomats in November that it was good that “tensions” were high with the West and that it was “important for them to remain in this state for as long as possible.”

He also held a meeting with his defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, who described Russia’s wide-ranging military exercises, and said that some were now ending or would end soon.

Western officials have expressed fears that the window for a diplomatic solution may be closing after a phone call between President Biden and Mr. Putin over the weekend resulted in “no fundamental change in the dynamic that has unfolded now for several weeks,” according to the White House.

As the Biden administration warns that a Russian invasion could be imminent, publicly available satellite imagery has documented a huge Russian military buildup around Ukraine, including naval vessels armed with missiles, and infantry, tank and airborne regiments capable of striking from multiple directions.

The United States has “good sources of intelligence” that indicate “that things are sort of building now to some kind of crescendo opportunity for Mr. Putin,” John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said on Sunday.

While Russia has repeatedly said it has no plans to launch an attack, it has continued to add to the arsenal threatening its neighbor. Last week, when asked about the possibility of invasion, Mr. Putin refused to rule it out .

Even as the Ukrainian government has sought to maintain calm, the country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said that Moscow needed to explain its actions and “fulfill its commitment to military transparency in order to de-escalate tensions and enhance security for all.”

KYIV, Ukraine — For Ukraine, joining the NATO security alliance is an aspiration enshrined in its constitution. And although Western leaders say membership is a distant prospect at best, Russia regards even the possibility as an existential threat.

That dispute is at the core of Russia’s menacing military buildup surrounding Ukraine. The United States and NATO have said that the decision to seek membership should be up to individual countries, and in public Ukrainian officials have insisted that there is no change in their position.

But on Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine did not rule out the possibility of dropping his country’s bid to join NATO, saying: “Maybe the question of open doors is for us like a dream.”

While emphasizing that NATO membership “is for our security and it is in the constitution,” Mr. Zelensky, speaking at a news conference alongside Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, acknowledged the difficult place the country finds itself in, nearly completely encircled by Russian or Russian-backed forces, and with partners like the United States insisting it will not send troops into Ukraine to repel a Russian invasion.

“How much should Ukraine go on that path?” Mr. Zelensky said of NATO membership. “Who will support us?”

Mr. Zelensky was responding to a question about comments made by Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to Britain, who told BBC radio on Sunday that his government was “flexible in trying to find the best way out” and was considering dropping the country’s NATO ambitions.

Since December, the Ukrainian government has been quietly pursuing negotiations that could lead to acceptance of some form of neutrality, or another solution more narrowly focused on Russian demands in a cease-fire agreement in the long-running conflict in eastern Ukraine .

In public, officials including the current foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, have rejected concessions as counterproductive and likely only to encourage further Russian aggression.

Mr. Prystaiko, a former foreign minister who served under President Zelensky, was asked in the BBC interview : “If it averts war, will your country contemplate not joining NATO, dropping that as a goal?”

He replied: “We might, especially being threatened like that, blackmailed like that, and pushed to it.”

While emphasizing that even commenting on the possibility could be seen as violating Ukrainian laws, he went on: “What I’m saying here, is we are flexible in trying to find the best way out. If we have to go through some serious concessions, that’s something we might do, that is for sure.”

His comments caused a stir, and the Ukrainian government quickly sought to clarify the matter. The spokesman for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, Oleh Nikolenko, tweeted that Mr. Prystaiko’s comments had been reported out of context. “Ukraine’s position remains unchanged,” he said. “The goal of NATO membership is enshrined in the constitution.”

Mr. Prystaiko later emphaisized in an interview with Yevropaiska Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, that “there are no changes now” to the country’s stance. But because Ukraine is not a member of the alliance, he said, in the current standoff with Russia “we cannot count on NATO because we are not a member of the family.”

The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, welcomed the ambassador’s comments while acknowledging the response from the Ukrainian foreign ministry.

“Clearly, Ukraine’s confirmed rejection of the idea of joining NATO would be a step that would significantly facilitate the formulation of a better response to Russia’s concerns,” Mr. Peskov said on Monday. But given the confusion around the comments, he added: “We cannot interpret it as a fact that Kyiv’s conceptual worldview has changed.”

Russian and Belarusian fighter jets continued large-scale joint military exercises including in airspace near Ukraine, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Monday , fueling concerns about a possible attack by Russia against its smaller neighbor.

The drills by Russia and its ally Belarus, which NATO has said involved tens of thousands of troops and are the largest in decades, carried on over the weekend in Belarus with artillery formations from both countries engaging in live-fire drills. Russia has described the exercises as routine.

On Monday, in the Gomel region of Belarus, north of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, Russian paratroopers worked at strengthening the country’s border with Ukraine and participated in training on repelling “groups of saboteurs,” the Belarusian Defense Ministry said in a statement describing the exercise.

The joint exercises, which have raised alarm in Western capitals that they could offer cover for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to launch an incursion into Ukraine from the north, were scheduled to end on Feb. 20. The Kremlin said last week that Russian troops — some of whom have been deployed from bases in Siberia and beyond, thousands of miles to the east — would leave Belarus after the drills end.

But on Monday, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus was cagey when asked whether the Russian troops would leave after the drills.

“This is our business with Putin,” Mr. Lukashenko said . “We will meet soon, and will make a decision about when Russian forces will be withdrawn and what the schedule and time frame will be.”

Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, confirmed that a meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Lukashenko would take place this week. Asked to clarify when Russian troops would leave Belarus, Mr. Peskov said: “Let’s not jump the gun.”

Russia’s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, said on Monday in a televised meeting with Mr. Putin that “some of the drills are already ending and some will end soon.”

In addition to military maneuvers in Belarus, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Monday that the Russian Armed Forces and Navy conducted exercises in Crimea , the Black Sea and in Transnistria , the breakaway region of Moldova that borders Ukraine — in effect encircling Ukraine on three sides by hostile forces.

Ukraine has conducted its own military drills, and on Monday the Ukrainian and Belarusian defense ministers spoke by phone. In an effort to calm tensions surrounding the maneuvers and “strengthen mutual trust,” the two sides agreed that a defense official from each country would visit exercises taking place in the other, according to a statement by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry .

The United States temporarily relocated its C.I.A. station in Kyiv on Tuesday, a day after the State Department announced its diplomatic corps would move to Lviv, a western city near the border with Poland, because of the Russian military buildup near Ukraine, according to officials briefed on the shift.

Removing C.I.A. officers from Kyiv could make collecting information on Russian activity inside Ukraine more difficult. The U.S. has been working to collect intelligence, declassify it and expose what officials have called various Russian plots to undermine or replace the Ukrainian government.

On Monday, the State Department also recommended that U.S. citizens leave Belarus and Transnistria, a Russian-backed breakaway region in Moldova. Both Belarus and Transnistria neighbor Ukraine.

The department had said on Saturday that it would move most of its diplomatic staff in Kyiv to Lviv, but not all, indicating that it would keep the embassy operating. A department spokesman, Ned Price, declined to say at a news briefing on Monday how many people remained in Kyiv and were covered by the decision to shut the embassy.

Amid fears of a Russian invasion , the United States has strongly urged its citizens to leave Ukraine and has ordered some personnel and their families out of the country.

Kyiv lies within easy reach of Russian forces massed in western Russia and in Belarus. Lviv sits nearly 300 miles farther west, close to Ukraine’s border with Poland .

“I have no higher priority than the safety and security of Americans around the world, and that, of course, includes our colleagues serving at our posts overseas,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in a statement.

Among those who have already relocated to Lviv, Mr. Price said, is Kristina A. Kvien, the embassy’s chargé d’affaires — the person in charge of an embassy when no ambassador is present. He said Ukrainian police would protect the compound in Kyiv.

“It is certainly our intention to return to that Embassy in Kyiv just as soon as it is safe for us to do so,” Mr. Price said.

Tracking Russia’s Latest Military Movements Around Ukraine
Videos, satellite images and social media posts reveal the scale and intensity of Russia’s military deployments near Ukraine’s border.

    U.S. officials are warning that Russia could invade Ukraine in a matter of days. Russia says its buildup of troops and weapons is part of planned military exercises. Satellite images, social media videos and photos show the scale and intensity of some of Russia’s latest deployments. The situation is volatile, and Russia’s military movements continue to cause fear and confusion. Satellite imagery from Sunday shows the arrival of new equipment, and vehicles being repositioned at a site just 17 miles from Ukraine. U.S. officials and independent military experts say at least half of Russia’s battalion tactical groups, which are designed for ground combat, have been deployed near Ukraine. Vehicles transporting short-range ballistic missile systems called Iskanders appear to be moving closer to the border, as seen here in Western Russia in February. Satellite images show that these types of weapons were also moved to a site in Belarus in January, putting them within range of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. And in mid-February, there was a new addition to the site: a field hospital. Another field hospital was also set up in Crimea, the part of Ukraine that was seized by Russia in 2014. In the same area, satellite images show a new camp for troops, which could indicate a higher level of military readiness. And in Belarus, videos show this Krasukha-4, one of Russia’s most powerful electronic warfare systems, about 50 miles from Ukraine. It has a range of up to 186 miles, and is typically used to interfere with military aircraft radar systems. Russia has also deployed helicopters, and more than half of these ground-attack aircraft recently arrived at an airfield in Belarus. It is also moved landing ships from Northern Europe that can transport tanks, armored vehicles and troops. Russia says 30 of its ships are taking part in live-fire exercises, but the fleet is also effectively blocking Ukraine’s ports, and further encircling the country.

Energy markets are jittery as Russia-Ukraine tensions drag on.

A Russian invasion of Ukraine could drive up already high oil and natural gas prices, prolonging elevated inflation around the world and dealing a blow to any country dependent on Russia for energy.

Oil and gas prices have been marching upward for months as exporting countries like Libya have struggled with production problems and demand has rapidly recovered after two years of the pandemic. But all of that pales in comparison with what could happen if a war in Eastern Europe and potential Western sanctions on Russia curtail that country’s production, analysts said.

Russia produces 10 million barrels of oil a day, roughly 10 percent of global demand, and is Europe’s largest supplier of natural gas, a critical fuel for power plants and for heat.

The United States is not a big importer of Russian oil — it gets about 700,000 barrels a day, or roughly 3 percent of its demand. But even Americans would be hurt because the price of the commodity is set in global markets.

Nobody quite knows what President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia intends to do in Ukraine, and most analysts agree that a war would hurt his country as much as the rest of the world, if not more, given the Russian economy’s dependence on energy. Yet, by simply amassing tens of thousands of troops near the Ukrainian border, Mr. Putin has created the kind of threat to the global energy market that the world hasn’t seen since the end of the Cold War.

“Governments had hoped that these days were over,” said David L. Goldwyn, who was a leading State Department energy diplomat during the Obama administration. “No one was gaming for a cutoff of Russian oil and gas to the global market.”

Oil prices have risen to well over $90 a barrel — their highest levels since 2014 — in recent days as fears of war have grown. Many energy experts say an invasion would easily propel the price above $100 a barrel. The average price for regular gasoline in the United States has risen to nearly $3.50, a rise of almost 20 cents over the last month and nearly $1 more than a year ago, according to AAA . Diesel prices have been rising a penny a gallon every day recently.

Higher fuel prices hurt rural and working-class consumers the most because they spend a larger percentage of their incomes on energy and because they typically drive longer distances in less fuel-efficient cars. For every penny that a gallon of regular gasoline rises, it costs American consumers $4 million a day, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service.

“We are going to push the envelope with inflation that infiltrates every nook and cranny of the economy,” Mr. Kloza said. “I’m most worried about diesel. It doesn’t provoke a public outcry like gasoline, but it can be a silent killer of commerce and profits.”

New satellite imagery shows widespread damage in residential areas and shopping centers in Mariupol, where fighting has been intense.

Oil markets rose about 2 percent on Monday. They eased early in the day as traders took note of reports that Russian officials remained willing to negotiate a potential settlement before climbing again in the afternoon. European natural gas prices rose about 6 percent.

The biggest immediate threat from an invasion would be Russian natural gas exports through Ukrainian pipelines to Europe. If the gas stopped flowing, many Europeans could struggle to heat their homes. Utilities might have to cut back electricity production, and factories might have to close early. Mr. Putin could also seek to further increase pressure on the West by restricting oil exports to Europe.

Those moves would, of course, hurt Russia, and make the economic sanctions promised by the Biden administration and its allies all the more punitive. That threat may turn out to be the primary reason Mr. Putin eventually looks for a compromise.

There are reasons to hope an energy crisis could be averted. The United States has been producing more oil in recent weeks, and the Biden administration is working on efforts to revive a nuclear deal with Iran that would release as much as a million barrels a day on the world market.

The European winter has been relatively mild, and the wind is blowing far stronger than last year, easing pressure on the wind power sector. Further, the Biden administration has had some success in sending more liquefied natural gas to Europe by persuading Japan and other Asian consumers to forgo some shipments.

But global oil production has not kept up over the last year with the growth of demand despite the lingering pandemic. The output of several members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has declined, and there have been production interruptions outside the cartel, including in Ecuador and Kazakhstan, because of natural disasters and political turmoil. Renewed political tension could also tip Libya back into civil war, which could put at risk 300,000 barrels of production or more.

“Simply the threat of war and disruption can be enough to send prices spiraling higher,” said Nishant Bhushan, senior oil market analyst at Rystad Energy, a consulting firm.

At the same time, many commuters have given up on mass transit because of fears of contracting the coronavirus and are driving more.

American oil companies have been gradually increasing production, although they are not yet pumping out the roughly 13 million barrels a day they were in 2019. Reduced investment in exploration and production because of the pandemic, and lower investor interest in oil and gas for environmental reasons, have stretched supplies thin.

Oil executives remain cautious, in part because they borrowed heavily in recent years to bolster output only to see prices drop. Some executives also said they were struggling to predict and respond to geopolitical developments.

“If Putin invades, then oil rises over $100 to $120 a barrel,” said Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas oil and gas company. “If Biden removes sanctions on Iran, then there will be a $10 drop.”

He added, “Demand is strong and there is not enough supply long term, so eventually oil will be over $100 regardless.”

Rising oil prices are also a threat to policies aimed at curbing climate change. As prices rise at the pump, some lawmakers and voters may become more willing to support increasing oil and gas production, seeing it as a more immediate solution to high energy prices than investing in, say, renewable energy and electric cars.

“This is a huge watershed for governments trying to manage the energy transition and energy security simultaneously,” said Mr. Goldwyn, the former Obama administration official. “The need to have adequate reserves of oil and gas and diverse sources of supply is more urgent than ever during an energy and geopolitical crisis.”

Some energy analysts said high prices might not persist for that long. That’s because people may seek to reduce their expenses by, for example, driving less or switching to more efficient vehicles and appliances. A report on Monday by analysts at RBC, an investment bank, forecast that oil prices could reach $115 a barrel or higher this summer. It added, “The oil cycle will price higher until it finds a level of demand destruction.”

The recent jump in gasoline prices comes at a time of year when people tend to drive less. To some energy experts, that is worrisome because a seasonal upswing in prices is not that far away.

“Not only are oil prices up, but the bulk of the nation is starting the multi-month transition to summer gasoline, further adding to the rise at the pump,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, a technology company that tracks fuel prices.

A diplomatic settlement, of course, would relieve the pressures, and energy prices would go down.

“Average prices in 2022 could be lower than 2021 with more supplies from the United States and the gulf, including Iran,” said René Ortiz, a former secretary general of OPEC and former oil minister in Ecuador. “That is the best scenario, and I think diplomacy will prevail. It would be crazy for Putin to invade.”

The Pentagon chief will visit Belgium and Eastern Europe this week.

Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III will meet with NATO leaders in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss Russia’s military buildup around Ukraine, the Pentagon announced on Monday.

Mr. Austin will then go to Poland to visit American troops and to Lithuania to meet with Baltic leaders, said John F. Kirby, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman.

Speaking on Monday, Mr. Kirby told reporters at the Pentagon that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was still prepared to strike at Ukraine, and dismissed Russian assertions that the buildup of some 130,000 troops was simply seasonal land and naval drills.

“It strains credulity to think that they would have this many troops arrayed along the border with Ukraine and in Belarus simply for winter exercises,” he said.

The Pentagon on Friday ordered 3,000 additional troops to Poland, bringing to 5,000 the number of reinforcements sent to Europe in the past two weeks.

The purpose of the troops, nearly all from the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., will be to reassure NATO allies that while the United States does not intend to send troops into Ukraine, President Biden would protect America’s NATO allies from any Russian aggression. Poland borders Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, a close ally of Russia.

Also on Monday, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Lt. Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, the commander in chief of Ukraine’s military, discussed the “security environment in Eastern Europe” during a phone call, the Joint Staff said in a statement.

“Ukraine is a key partner to NATO and plays a critical role in maintaining peace and stability in Europe,” it said.

The day before he is scheduled to meet President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, visited Kyiv on Monday to promise full support to Ukraine in the case of a Russian invasion.

“In the event of military escalation, we are ready for very far-reaching and effective sanctions in coordination with our allies,” Mr. Scholz said during a joint news conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

Mr. Scholz, who was criticized for weeks for being slow to respond to the Russian military buildup surrounding Ukraine, has recently sought to demonstrate solidarity with the United States and NATO allies in condemning the Russian threat.

After a meeting with Mr. Zelensky that went on longer than scheduled, Mr. Scholz said at the news conference that it was up to Russia to respond to proposals by the United States and NATO to address Moscow’s concerns surrounding security in Eastern Europe. Russian officials have indicated that those responses were being finalized.

“NATO and the U.S. have made specific proposals to Russia, which we support,” Mr. Scholz said.

Although Mr. Scholz said his country would continue to support Ukraine with financial aid, and that he would be encouraging German business to invest in the country, he once again ruled out sending any weaponry.

“No country in the world has provided such strong financial support to Ukraine over the past eight years,” he said.

Mr. Scholz was scheduled to return to Berlin on Monday night before flying to Moscow on Tuesday morning.

He would become the latest Western leader to attempt shuttle diplomacy between Moscow and Kyiv, with previous efforts, including by President Emmanuel Macron of France last week, bearing little fruit. There is scant expectation that Mr. Scholz would fare any better, although the continued drumbeat of high-level diplomatic meetings left hopes of pulling back from the brink of a war that nearly all observers agree would be catastrophic.

Israel urges its citizens to leave Ukraine, but finds few takers so far.

JERUSALEM — Israel’s Ministry of Immigration said Monday that it is preparing contingency plans for a possible wave of Jewish immigrants from Ukraine, even though officials said there was no sign yet of a surge in applications from people looking to get out of the country.

Israel is one of more than a dozen nations that have urged their citizens to leave the country, fearing that a full-scale war with Russia could break out any day.

The minister for immigration, Pnina Tamano-Shata, said Israel was prepared for any scenario. But other officials said that an emergency airlift to evacuate Jews was not likely, particularly if hostilities broke out and airports were closed.

Up to 200,000 Ukrainians are believed to be eligible for automatic Israeli citizenship either because they are Jews or they have family connections. The local community of involved Ukrainian Jews is thought to be less than 50,000.

Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ immediate priority is to persuade the thousands of Israeli citizens who are still in Ukraine to leave the country while the situation remains stable, according to officials in Jerusalem.

Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a travel warning on Friday advising Israeli citizens in Ukraine to reconsider staying there and said it was evacuating the families of Israeli diplomats from the embassy in Kyiv.

After few Israelis immediately heeded the advice, the ministry issued a stronger warning on Saturday calling on them to leave as soon as possible and saying the ministry was reinforcing the embassy with additional staff to manage emergency consular matters.

About 10,000 to 15,000 Israelis are estimated to be in Ukraine, including many Arab citizens who are studying medicine in the country. About 6,000 Israelis in Ukraine registered online with the ministry to receive official updates, and about 1,000 of them left Ukraine on Sunday. About 30 flights that are scheduled to leave Ukraine for Israel this week have not been fully booked as of Monday.

The Jewish Agency for Israel, a quasi-governmental body also involved with immigration, has evacuated about 24 representatives serving in educational programs, along with their families. Senior representatives and about 100 local employees of the organization have remained in Ukraine to support the Jewish community.

An international monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine shrinks as nations withdraw their staffs.

KYIV, Ukraine — Several countries including the United States are pulling their citizens from a cease-fire monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine, diminishing the international observer mission even as the threat of military action grows.

American members of the monitoring mission, operated by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or O.S.C.E., began pulling out over the weekend, after the State Department ordered all nonemergency U.S. diplomats and embassy employees to leave Ukraine. Britain is expected to withdraw its nationals from territories controlled by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine by Tuesday.

The O.S.C.E. mission confirmed in a statement that some countries had decided to withdraw their monitors from Ukraine “within the next days,” but did not specify which countries.

The O.S.C.E. group, called the Special Monitoring Mission, is an unarmed civilian mission that works on both sides of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been locked in a deadly stalemate with Russian-backed rebels since 2014. The mission’s main work is watching and producing reports on the conflict, making them the only truly independent source of information for the international community on the ground in eastern Ukraine.

Most of the several hundred observers are diplomats or former military officers seconded to the O.S.C.E. by member states, which include the United States and Russia. Other countries, including Austria, have said they plan to leave their observers in place for now.

American members of the mission were seen leaving a hotel on Sunday in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, Reuters reported. A spokesman for the U.S. mission in Ukraine, Daniel Langenkamp, told Ukrainian media that the American observers were “very vulnerable.”

“While we strongly support the important work” of the monitoring mission, Mr. Langenkamp said, “the safety of U.S. citizens is our priority.”

Russia has not announced its plans for Russian nationals in the mission. The spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said the American decision to withdraw its monitors suggested an effort to hinder the mission’s reporting on Ukrainian military operations.

As warnings mount that a Russian invasion could happen at any moment, some airlines have suspended flights to Ukraine, diplomats have begun to depart and countries around the world have urged their citizens to leave.

But many foreigners in Ukraine have not rushed to get out.

“I am not going anywhere,” said Thomas Jones, a British national who moved to Ukraine seven years ago to help a nongovernmental organization distribute food and medical supplies after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. He is now married to a Ukrainian woman and works as an English teacher, writer and translator.

Lamenting a “media frenzy of panic” by Western broadcasters over the current crisis, he said that Ukrainians have lived with the constant threat of Russia and Russian-backed separatists since 2014 and were now used to it, prepared and relatively calm.

“It’s not like people are running to the shops and buying a container load of toilet paper and canned food,” he said.

His view echoed that of many foreigners in Ukraine who in recent weeks have been pulled between warnings from Western governments and urging from the Ukrainian government not to panic .

Following weeks of frantic diplomatic talks that seemed to bear little success, more than a dozen countries — including the United States, Australia, Britain, Italy, Israel and Kuwait — have asked their citizens to leave the country because of safety concerns. The United States on Saturday ordered its embassy in Kyiv to draw down to a “bare minimum” level of staffing.

France has taken a different tack, however, saying on Sunday that it was not advising the estimated 1,000 French nationals living in Ukraine to leave. The French ambassador to Kyiv said in a statement that the two nations should not postpone important economic projects.

Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, reported on Sunday that an unusually high number of private and chartered jets were departing Kyiv, a possible sign that the country’s elite was packing up.

But for many foreigners, their reluctance to leave Ukraine was rooted in financial concerns. Roberto Marcuccio, who lives in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, said he left everything in his native Italy behind five years ago to make a new life there. He is married to a Ukrainian woman, works for his wife’s billboard business and has a 5-year-old son.

“What am I going to do in Italy? I have no family who can help me, what am I going to eat, how I am going to live?” said Mr. Marcuccio, 48. “I am only going to leave when they start shooting,” he added.

The State Department said that about 6,600 Americans were residing in Ukraine as of October, but that the total number of U.S. nationals in the country could be as high as 16,000, including tourists and visitors.

John Jones, a 63-year-old Californian who owns a solar panel manufacturer in Ukraine, was determined to stay in Kyiv, unwilling to turn his back on colleagues and friends.

“You can’t leave a business unattended,” he said, “and I wouldn’t leave if all my people didn’t also leave.”

With crises all around, Ukraine’s president tries to project optimism.

KYIV, Ukraine — Russian attack helicopters were spotted buzzing within miles of his country’s borders on Sunday. The last strands of diplomacy were unraveling. Allies evacuated their embassies, some airlines canceled flights, and a large number of private jets departed from the capital.

For Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president and a former comedic actor who was elected three years ago on a message of optimism about his country’s relations with Russia — something that now seems a distant memory — room for maneuver narrowed over the weekend to a tiny selection of uncertain options.

During a phone call on Sunday with President Biden, Mr. Zelensky issued an invitation for a visit, so the American president could “contribute to de-escalation” with his presence in Kyiv. The United States has already ordered most American diplomats to leave, making a presidential visit unlikely.

But the 44-year-old Ukrainian president is clinging to the strategy he has pursued for months, using every appearance to caution against panic and overreaction, to the point of seeming nearly delusional about the grave risks his country faces.

Mr. Zelensky has remained engaged in diplomacy even as no clear path to a settlement is in focus, while instructing his military to signal, as it said in a statement over the weekend, that Ukraine is “absolutely ready to fight.”

Adhering to a disciplined public relations strategy has been a hallmark of Mr. Zelensky’s tenure, seen as springing from the background he and important aides share in the entertainment industry.
