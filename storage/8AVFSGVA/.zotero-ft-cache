Abstract 
 
Literature on biomass is reviewed, and 178 sets of published equations for 25 species common to the Northeastern United States are listed. On the basis of these equations, estimates of above ground oven-dry weight of trees from 2.5 to 50.0 cm diameter at breast height for each species are presented and discussed.
