 at the White House, Biden said the Kremlin had flagrantly violated 
international law in what he called the “beginning of a Russian invasion
 of Ukraine.” He warned of more sanctions if Putin went further. </p><div data-key="media-placeholder"><div class="YoutubeEmbed youtubeEmbed"><div class="vertical-wrapper"><div class="vertical-limit"></div><img alt="ratio" class="ratio" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAAAAAAeQfPuAAAAC0lEQVQYGWMYrAAAAJkAAWzZLOIAAAAASUVORK5CIIA="></div><div class="horizontal-limit"></div><div class="youtube-player" id="youtube-wrapper-0w4Z4Z2wmJU-article"><img class="thumbnail" src="" alt="Youtube video thumbnail"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“We
 are united in our support of Ukraine,” Biden said. “We are united in 
our opposition to Russian aggression.” When it comes to Russian claims 
of a justification or pretext for an invasion, Biden said, “None of us 
should be fooled. None of us will be fooled. There is no justification.”
 </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Hopes for a 
diplomatic resolution to the threat of invasion, which U.S. officials 
have for weeks portrayed as all but inevitable, appeared to evaporate. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled plans for a Thursday 
meeting in Geneva with his Russian counterpart, saying it would not be 
productive and that Russia’s actions indicated Moscow was not serious 
about a peaceful path to resolving the crisis.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Western nations sought to present a united front, with more than two dozen European Union members unanimously agreeing to levy <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-asia-europe-united-nations-881717d75ad21662562dec7b5c8f43b0"> their own initial set of sanctions </a><!-- -->
 against Russian officials. Germany also said it was halting the process
 of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia — a lucrative 
deal long sought by Moscow but criticized by the U.S. for increasing 
Europe’s reliance on Russian energy.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-75"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-33">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-36"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-34"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle2" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-32"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The U.S., meanwhile, <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">moved to cut off Russia’s government from Western finance</a><!-- -->,
 sanctioning two of its banks and blocking it from trading in its debt 
on American and European markets. The administration’s actions hit 
civilian leaders in Russia’s leadership hierarchy and two Russian banks 
considered especially close to the Kremlin and Russia’s military, with 
more than $80 billion in assets. That includes freezing all of those 
banks’ assets under U.S. jurisdictions.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Biden,
 though, did hold back some of the broadest and toughest of the 
financial penalties contemplated by the U.S., including sanctions that 
would reinforce the hold that Germany put on any startup of the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline; an export ban that would deny Russia U.S. high tech 
for its industries and military; and sweeping bans that could cripple 
Russia’s ability to do business with the rest of the world.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Biden
 said he was moving additional U.S. troops to the Baltics, though he 
described the deployments as purely “defensive,” asserting, “We have no 
intention of fighting Russia.” The U.S. is sending about 800 infantry 
troops and 40 attack aircraft to NATO’s eastern flank from other 
locations within Europe, according to a senior defense official. In 
addition, a contingent of F-35 strike fighters and AH-64 Apache attack 
helicopters will also be relocated.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Earlier
 Tuesday, members of Russia’s upper house, the Federation Council, voted
 unanimously to allow Putin to use military force outside the country — 
effectively formalizing a Russian military deployment to the rebel 
regions, where an eight-year conflict has killed nearly 14,000 people. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Shortly
 afterward, Putin laid out three conditions to end the crisis that has 
threatened to plunge Europe back into war, raising the specter of 
massive casualties, <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-climate-business-russia-europe-a4e956253d3640084f8bdfaa2c901be8">energy shortages across the continent</a><!-- --> and <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-asia-tokyo-europe-e6b1a6678833d81272b2dd7b130aa25a">global economic chaos</a><!-- -->.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Putin
 said the crisis could be resolved if Kyiv recognizes Russia’s 
sovereignty over Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow annexed 
after seizing it from Ukraine in 2014, renounces its bid to join NATO 
and partially demilitarizes. The West has decried the annexation of 
Crimea as a violation of international law and has previously flatly 
rejected permanently barring Ukraine from NATO. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Asked
 whether he has sent any Russian troops into Ukraine and how far they 
could go, Putin responded: “I haven’t said that the troops will go there
 right now.” He added that “it’s impossible to forecast a specific 
pattern of action — it will depend on a concrete situation as it takes 
shape on the ground.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The
 EU announced initial sanctions aimed at the 351 Russian lawmakers who 
voted for recognizing the two separatist regions in Ukraine, as well as 
27 other Russian officials and institutions from the defense and banking
 sectors. They also sought to limit Moscow’s access to EU capital and 
financial markets. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">With
 tensions rising and a broader conflict looking more likely, the White 
House began referring to the Russian deployments in the region known as 
the Donbas as an “invasion” after initially hesitating to use the term —
 a red line that Biden had said would result in severe sanctions. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“We
 think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia’s latest 
invasion into Ukraine,” Jon Finer, principal deputy national security 
adviser, said on CNN. “An invasion is an invasion, and that is what is 
underway.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">The 
White House announced limited sanctions targeting the rebel regions on 
Monday evening soon after Putin said he was sending in troops. A senior 
Biden administration official, who briefed reporters about those 
sanctions, noted “that Russia has occupied these regions since 2014” and
 that “Russian troops moving into Donbas would not itself be a new 
step.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Western 
leaders have long warned Moscow would look for cover to invade — and 
just such a pretext appeared to come Monday, when Putin recognized the 
independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk separatist regions. The Kremlin 
then raised the stakes further by saying that recognition extends even 
to the large parts of those two regions now held by Ukrainian forces, 
including the major Azov Sea port of Mariupol. He added, however, that 
the rebels should eventually negotiate with Ukraine.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Condemnation
 from around the world was quick. In Washington, lawmakers from both 
parties in Congress vowed continued U.S. support for Ukraine, even as 
some pushed for swifter and even more severe sanctions on Russia. 
Senators had been considering a sanctions package but held off as the 
White House pursued its strategy.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Ukrainian
 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would consider breaking 
diplomatic ties with Russia, and Kyiv recalled its ambassador in Moscow.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">If
 Putin pushes farther into Ukraine, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg insisted
 the West would move in lockstep. “If Russia decides once again to use 
force against Ukraine, there will be even stronger sanctions, even a 
higher price to pay,” he said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">British
 Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the U.K. would slap sanctions on five
 Russian banks and three wealthy individuals. He warned a full-scale 
offensive would bring “further powerful sanctions.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Zelenskyy
 said he was calling up some of the country’s military reservists but 
added there was no need for a full military mobilization.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">In
 an address to the nation, Zelenskyy said his decree applied only to 
those assigned to the so-called operational reserve, which is typically 
activated during ongoing hostilities, and covers “a special period of 
time,” without clarifying what that means.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“Today
 there is no need for a full mobilization. We need to quickly add 
additional staff to the Ukrainian army and other military formations,” 
he said. The head of the National Security and Defense Council, Oleksii 
Danilov, said earlier this year that Ukraine can call up up to 2.5 
million people.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Karmanau

Victory in the Club World Cup last month completed the set of major honors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The success has been funded by around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) of loans to the club that Abramovich said he didn't want repaid when putting the club up for sale last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHY SANCTION ABRAMOVICH?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich has used legal means to try to publicly distance himself from benefiting from an association with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The British government thinks otherwise, saying Abramovich has obtained “a financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the government of Russia,\" including tax breaks, the sale of shares at favorable rates, and contracts in the buildup to Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich “is or has been involved in destabilizing Ukraine” via Evraz, a steel manufacturing and mining company which he effectively controls and has potentially supplied the Russia military, the government said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His fortune was made in oil and aluminium following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2005, Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom paid $13 billion for the Sibneft oil company controlled by Abramovich. It allowed Putin’s Kremlin to recapture state influence in the lucrative energy industry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON CHELSEA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The sanctions could have immediately forced Chelsea to stop running as a business, and preventing its teams from completing their seasons. Instead, a special license has been issued to allow it to continue operating, subject to heavy restrictions.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Only fans already with tickets — mainly season ticket holders — can attend matches, shutting out away fans from games. The club's shop had to close on Thursday morning. Staff at the hotel built onto Stamford Bridge said they were under orders to no longer accept new reservations or sell food and drink.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Only 500,000 pounds ($657,000) can be spent on staging each match at Stamford Bridge, including on security and catering. A maximum of 20,000 pounds can be spent on travel to matches. Chelsea plays in France at Lille in the Champions League next week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Player recruitment is also prohibited under the terms of the government license that runs through May 31. There are players with contracts expiring at the end of the season in June and the sanctions create uncertainty over whether Cesar Azpilicueta, Toni Rudiger and Andreas Christensen could be offered new deals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>CAN CHELSEA STILL BE SOLD?\u003c/p>\u003cp>As calls grew in the British parliament for Abramovich to be sanctioned, Chelsea was put up for sale.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated,” Abramovich said. “The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>It gave the impression of being an entity that Abramovich would be involved with. The foundation could have benefited Russian victims, too.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chelsea sought potential bidders to register their interest by next week. But now the government has oversight of the process.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“While the current license does not permit the sale of the club at this time, the government is open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a new license to allow for a sale,” the government said. “Proceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"BorisJohnson","name":"Boris Johnson","canonicalName":"boris-johnson","isPr":false},{"id":"Soccer","name":"Soccer","canonicalName":"soccer","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-sports","name":"Sports","canonicalName":"sports","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-EuropeanSports","name":"Sports - Europe","canonicalName":"sports-europe","isPr":false},{"id":"London","name":"London","canonicalName":"london","isPr":false},{"id":"PremierLeague","name":"Premier League","canonicalName":"premier-league","isPr":false},{"id":"RomanAbramovich","name":"Roman Abramovich","canonicalName":"roman-abramovich","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null}],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":"Russia-Ukraine","hubPeekTagName":"Russia-Ukraine war","hubPeekCanonicalName":"russia-ukraine","hubPeekIsPr":false,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"Column List","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":"Compressed","endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null}},"loadedAt":{"afs:Card:929358031793":1646935924979},"expiration":120000},"content":{"loading":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:46cef648807d0e3c2bac9793ad9022a6":false,"urn:publicid:ap.org:a05e7c4563ac94b963134bba83187d46":false,"urn:publicid:ap.org:303b0bfdc6148c8738d6ac0ca78142fd":false},"error":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:46cef648807d0e3c2bac9793ad9022a6":null,"urn:publicid:ap.org:a05e7c4563ac94b963134bba83187d46":null,"urn:publicid:ap.org:303b0bfdc6148c8738d6ac0ca78142fd":null},"data":{"urn:publicid:ap.org:46cef648807d0e3c2bac9793ad9022a6":{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:46cef648807d0e3c2bac9793ad9022a6","shortId":"46cef648807d0e3c2bac9793ad9022a6","etag":"46cef648807d0e3c2bac9793ad9022a6_39a25aza0c0","bylines":"By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, YURAS KARMANAU, AAMER MADHANI and ERIC TUCKER","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>MOSCOW (AP) — The East-West faceoff over Ukraine escalated dramatically Tuesday, with Russian lawmakers authorizing President Vladimir Putin to use military force outside his country and U.S. President Joe Biden and European leaders responding by slapping sanctions on Russian oligarchs and banks.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"Biden, Putin signal bigger confrontation ahead over Ukraine","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"fe0cf6d1d9074e758a7471011b703ce4","leadVideoId":"fd6ee795ba8248948dfd427cd606421a","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/46cef648807d0e3c2bac9793ad9022a6","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"fd6ee795ba8248948dfd427cd606421a","type":"YouTube","caption":"\u003cp>President Joe Biden says the US will sanction Russian oligarchs and Russian sovereign debt in retaliation for the country’s invasion of Ukraine. \"None of us will be fooled,\" by Russian President Vladimir Putin's claims about Ukraine, Biden said.

The administration's actions hit civilian leaders in Russia’s leadership hierarchy and two Russian banks considered especially close to the Kremlin and Russia’s military, with more than $80 billion in assets. That includes freezing all of those banks' assets under U.S. jurisdictions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden, though, did hold back some of the broadest and toughest of the financial penalties contemplated by the U.S., including sanctions that would reinforce the hold that Germany put on any startup of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline; an export ban that would deny Russia U.S. high tech for its industries and military; and sweeping bans that could cripple Russia’s ability to do business with the rest of the world.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden said he was moving additional U.S. troops to the Baltics, though he described the deployments as purely “defensive,\" asserting, “We have no intention of fighting Russia.” The U.S. is sending about 800 infantry troops and 40 attack aircraft to NATO’s eastern flank from other locations within Europe, according to a senior defense official. In addition, a contingent of F-35 strike fighters and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters will also be relocated.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Earlier Tuesday, members of Russia's upper house, the Federation Council, voted unanimously to allow Putin to use military force outside the country — effectively formalizing a Russian military deployment to the rebel regions, where an eight-year conflict has killed nearly 14,000 people. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Shortly afterward, Putin laid out three conditions to end the crisis that has threatened to plunge Europe back into war, raising the specter of massive casualties, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-climate-business-russia-europe-a4e956253d3640084f8bdfaa2c901be8\">energy shortages across the continent\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-asia-tokyo-europe-e6b1a6678833d81272b2dd7b130aa25a\">global economic chaos\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Putin said the crisis could be resolved if Kyiv recognizes Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow annexed after seizing it from Ukraine in 2014, renounces its bid to join NATO and partially demilitarizes. The West has decried the annexation of Crimea as a violation of international law and has previously flatly rejected permanently barring Ukraine from NATO. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Asked whether he has sent any Russian troops into Ukraine and how far they could go, Putin responded: “I haven’t said that the troops will go there right now.\" He added that “it’s impossible to forecast a specific pattern of action — it will depend on a concrete situation as it takes shape on the ground.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The EU announced initial sanctions aimed at the 351 Russian lawmakers who voted for recognizing the two separatist regions in Ukraine, as well as 27 other Russian officials and institutions from the defense and banking sectors. They also sought to limit Moscow’s access to EU capital and financial markets. \u003c/p>\u003cp>With tensions rising and a broader conflict looking more likely, the White House began referring to the Russian deployments in the region known as the Donbas as an “invasion” after initially hesitating to use the term — a red line that Biden had said would result in severe sanctions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia’s latest invasion into Ukraine,” Jon Finer, principal deputy national security adviser, said on CNN. “An invasion is an invasion, and that is what is underway.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The White House announced limited sanctions targeting the rebel regions on Monday evening soon after Putin said he was sending in troops. A senior Biden administration official, who briefed reporters about those sanctions, noted “that Russia has occupied these regions since 2014” and that “Russian troops moving into Donbas would not itself be a new step.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Western leaders have long warned Moscow would look for cover to invade — and just such a pretext appeared to come Monday, when Putin recognized the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk separatist regions. The Kremlin then raised the stakes further by saying that recognition extends even to the large parts of those two regions now held by Ukrainian forces, including the major Azov Sea port of Mariupol. He added, however, that the rebels should eventually negotiate with Ukraine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Condemnation from around the world was quick. In Washington, lawmakers from both parties in Congress vowed continued U.S. support for Ukraine, even as some pushed for swifter and even more severe sanctions on Russia. Senators had been considering a sanctions package but held off as the White House pursued its strategy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would consider breaking diplomatic ties with Russia, and Kyiv recalled its ambassador in Moscow.\u003c/p>\u003cp>If Putin pushes farther into Ukraine, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg insisted the West would move in lockstep. “If Russia decides once again to use force against Ukraine, there will be even stronger sanctions, even a higher price to pay,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the U.K. would slap sanctions on five Russian banks and three wealthy individuals. He warned a full-scale offensive would bring “further powerful sanctions.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Zelenskyy said he was calling up some of the country’s military reservists but added there was no need for a full military mobilization.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In an address to the nation, Zelenskyy said his decree applied only to those assigned to the so-called operational reserve, which is typically activated during ongoing hostilities, and covers “a special period of time,” without clarifying what that means.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Today there is no need for a full mobilization. We need to quickly add additional staff to the Ukrainian army and other military formations,” he said. The head of the National Security and Defense Council, Oleksii Danilov, said earlier this year that Ukraine can call up up to 2.5 million people.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Karmanau reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.

His grasp on power increasingly tenuous, he called Thursday for even more severe sanctions than the ones imposed by Western allies and ordered a full military mobilization that would last 90 days.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Zelenskyy said in a video address that 137 “heroes,” including 10 military officers, had been killed and 316 people wounded.

Other nations also announced sanctions, or said they would shortly.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was always about naked aggression, about Putin’s desire for empire by any means necessary — by bullying Russia’s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause,” Biden said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Blinken said in television interviews that he was convinced that Russia was intent on overthrowing the Ukrainian government, telling CBS that Putin wants to “reconstitute the Soviet empire\" and that Kyiv was already “under threat, and it could well be under siege.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Fearing a Russian attack on the capital city, thousands of people went deep underground as night fell, jamming Kyiv's subway stations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At times it felt almost cheerful.
