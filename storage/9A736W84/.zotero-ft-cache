 
A CS Research Topic Generator 
or 
How To pick A Worthy Topic In 10 Seconds 
 
 
Computer Science is facing a major roadblock to further research. The problem is most evident with students, but afflicts many researchers as well: people simply have a tough time inventing research topics that sound sufficiently profound and exciting. Many Ph.D. students waste needless years simply coming up with a thesis topic. And researchers often resort to reading documents from government grant agencies so they will know what to work on for the next proposal! 
 
Good news for the CS community: the problem has at last been solved. The table below provides the answer. 
 
Column 1 	Column 2 	Column 3 
		 
integrated 	mobility 	network 
parallel 	functional 	preprocessor 
virtual 	programmable 	compiler 
interactive 	distributed 	system 
responsive 	logical 	interface 
synchronized 	digital 	protocol 
balanced 	concurrent 	architecture 
virtual 	knowledge-based 	database 
meta-level 	multimedia 	algorithm 
optimized 	binary 	toolkit 
active 	object-oriented 	display 
parameterized 	secure 	technology 
conceptual 	high-speed 	solution 
scalable 	real-time 	language 
dynamic 	functional 	agent 
high-level 	parallelizing 	theorem prover 
collaborative 	watermarking 	work cluster 
type-safe 	proxy 	cache 
reliable 	cloud-based 	network 
open 	big data 	data center 
coordinated 	bioinformatic 	hypervisor 
 
 
To generate a technical phrase, randomly choose one item from each column. For example, selecting synchronized from column 1, secure from column 2, and protocol from column 3 produces: 
 
A synchronized secure protocol 
 
 
Best of all, two phrases can be combined with simple connectives, making the result suitable for the most demanding use. Possible connectives include: 
 
for 
related to 
derived from 
applied to 
embedded in 
 
 
For example, one could generate a thesis title by selecting a second phrase and a connective: 
 
A synchronized secure protocol for an interactive knowledge-based system 
 
 
The technique described here for selecting a research topic is far superior to the method currently in use because it can be automated -- a computer program can be written to select a phrase at random whenever one is needed. Furthermore, thanks to an enhancement by Ian Stark at The University of Edinburgh in Scotland, it is possible to automate an additional step in the research process by performing an automated literature search. Try the system by first generating a random topic and then performing an automated literature search.
