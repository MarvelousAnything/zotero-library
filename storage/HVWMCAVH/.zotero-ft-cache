Gold futures jumped on Thursday to settle above $1,900 an ounce for the first time since June of last year, as a flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine renewed concerns about a wider military conflict.

“Gold’s move above $1,900 is obviously based on the Russia-Ukraine tensions, so I do expect a pull-back when and if peace breaks out,” Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter, told MarketWatch.

However, this situation is really a “a mix of ‘cold war and hot inflation,’ because beneath the geopolitical issues are powerful fundamentals that had been driving gold higher since late January,” he said.

“ The situation for gold is “a mix of cold war and hot inflation,’ because beneath the geopolitical issues are powerful fundamentals that had been driving gold higher since late January.” ”

The Federal Reserve is now less than four weeks away from its first expected interest rate hike since 2018, and “these initial hikes in a cycle have reliably marked the beginnings of significant gold rallies,” said Lundin. “I expect the same this time around and, even if gold corrects a bit when things calm down from a geopolitical standpoint, the price will likely remain higher than it was before.”

Against that backdrop, gold for April delivery  GCJ22 GC00 rose $30.50, or 1.6%, to settle at $1,902 an ounce. That marked the highest settlement for the most-active contract since June 2, 2021, FactSet data show.

Officials supporting Russia in the Donbas region have accused Ukraine’s armed forces of launching grenades and mortar attacks into the Russia-backed region, which would be a breach of cease-fire agreements.

The accusations come as Moscow has been seen continuing to build up troops along the Ukraine border, despite claiming that it is withdrawing forces, according to U.S. intelligence.

Gold has been reacting to the geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe, as well as evidence that inflation is surging in many parts of the world in the aftershocks from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Prices for the metal have climbed this month, benefitting mainly from “haven-investment demand brought about by the U.S.-Russia tension over Ukraine and concerns of persistent, elevated inflation,” said Jeff Klearman, portfolio manager at GraniteShares, which offers the GraniteShares Gold Trust BAR .

Overall, however, the upside for gold has been somewhat limited by concerns about central banks plans to raise interest rates to combat high inflation. The minutes released on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve’s late-January policy meeting, however, didn’t imply that the central bank was adopting a more hawkish stance than investors have already anticipated.

The meeting minutes seemed to indicate the Fed would act to increase rates “more cautiously than previously believed, adding to inflation concerns and supporting gold prices,” Klearman told MarketWatch.

He points out that while 10-year real yields have increased 25 basis points since the end of January, from -71 basis points to -46 basis points, they are still negative despite growing expectations the Fed will tighten six or more times this year.

“Even more importantly 10-year inflation expectations have not declined, hovering near 2.5%,” Klearman said. “Both these facts indicate the market is not convinced the Fed’s current policies are aggressive enough to reduce inflation going forward, which is supportive of gold prices.”

March silver  SIH22 SI00 also moved up by 27 cents, or 1.1%, to end at $23.875 an ounce, following a 1.1% gain a day ago. The settlement was the highest since Jan. 25.

Prices for silver moved up to session highs in the first few minutes after the release of U.S. data on weekly jobless claims and housing starts, as did gold, but both metals then temporarily pared back those gains.

In U.S. economic data, new applications for unemployment benefits jumped by 23,000 to 248,000 last week to break a string of recent declines. Meanwhile, U.S. home builders started construction on homes at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of roughly 1.64 million in January — roughly 4% decrease from the previous month

In other Comex trading Thursday, March copper HGH22 edged lower by 0.3% to $4.523 a pound. April platinum PLJ22 rose 2.7% to $1,092.70 an ounce and March palladium PAH22 settled at $2,359.10 an ounce, up almost 3.9%.
