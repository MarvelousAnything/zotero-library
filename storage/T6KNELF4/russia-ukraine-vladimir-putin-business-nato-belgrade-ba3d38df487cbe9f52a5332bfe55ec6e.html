nation, have criticized the attack on Ukraine but have refused to join 
Western sanctions against Russia, reflecting historically close 
relations. Serbia is a rare Russian ally in Europe despite seeking 
European Union membership, and pro-Russia propaganda is the country is 
strong.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">On 
Sunday, Serbia President Aleksandar Vucic met with Russian Ambassador 
Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the 
two countries’ bilateral ties. Vucic said that Serbia will observe its 
“vital political and economic interests and preserving peace and 
stability.”</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-75"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-33">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-36"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-34"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle2" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-32"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">There
 have been fears that tensions over the war in Ukraine could spill over 
to the volatile Balkans, which went through a series of ethnic wars in 
the 1990s. Serbia has relied on Russia to back its opposition to 
Western-backed independence of the former Kosovo province, which split 
after a NATO intervention in 1999.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">For
 Irina, a 47-year-old Russian language teacher who has lived in Serbia 
for the past nine years with her husband and daughter, supporters of 
Putin in Serbia should be aware that however painful a history between 
nations may be “no normal person should support the war. ”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">“Any
 normal person is for peace and truth, and Putin is not the truth, truth
 is not war,” said Irina, who gave only her first name because of fear 
of repercussions. “There is no reason for our children to die.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-80 Component-p-0-2-71">Follow the AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at <a class="" href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p></div></div></div><div class="Component-footer-0-2-1 -footer"><div class="fluid-wrapper"><div class="Component-grid-0-2-2"><nav class="Component-nav-0-2-3"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">AP NEWS</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-news">Top Stories</a></li><li><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/videos">Video</a></li><li><a href="mailto:support@apnews.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="https://apnews.com/accessibility-statement">Accessibility Statement</a></li><li><button class="optanon-show-settings">Cookie Settings</button></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-apps-0-2-4"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Download AP NEWS</div><div class="Component-downloadDescription-0-2-11">Connect with the definitive source for global and local news</div><div class="Component-list-0-2-13"></div></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-moreFromAp-0-2-5"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">More from AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-10"><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/">ap.org</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://insights.ap.org/">AP Insights</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.ap.org/">AP Definitive Source Blog</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://apimagesblog.com/">AP Images Spotlight</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/explore/">AP Explore</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/books/">AP Books</a></li></ol></nav><div class="ssr-mobile Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><nav class="Component-followAp-0-2-6"><div class="Component-title-0-2-9">Follow AP</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-17"><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/AP" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-twitter"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/APNews" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-facebook"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AssociatedPress" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-youtube"></use></svg></a></li><li class="Component-item-0-2-18"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/associated-press" class="Component-icon-0-2-19"><svg class="SvgSprite"><use xlink:href="/dist/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-linkedin"></use></svg></a></li></ol></nav><div class="Component-divider-0-2-7 Component-divider-0-2-12"></div><div class="Component-legalStuff-0-2-8 Component-legalStuff-0-2-20"><nav class="Component-legalStuffNav-0-2-21"><div class="Component-title-0-2-24 Component-spaceBelow-0-2-27">The Associated Press</div><ol class="Component-list-0-2-22"><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/about/">About</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/contact-us/">Contact</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://aphelp.ap.org/">Customer Support</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ap.org/careers/">Careers</a></li><li class="Component-listItem-0-2-23"><a href="https://apnews.com/termsofservice">Terms &amp;

The study found that it wouldn’t be possible for the cooling water to reach boiling temperature and the fuel rods would not be uncovered to start a real meltdown, Lyman said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE PHYSICS OF COOLING FUEL RODS\u003c/p>\u003cp>When fuel rods are spent after generating power, they still have lots of internal radioactivity and are still hot. Internal radioactive decay gives off heat and remains in the fuel rods for tens of thousands of years, so they can get hotter unless something is done to cool them, Regan said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The rods are put in cooling pools or ponds where both water and an active electric-powered system cools them with a heat exchange pump.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“As soon as you stop the coolant, as soon as you stop the mechanism for taking the heat off, it (temperature) will increase,” Regan said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Eventually in most plants, the radioactivity and heat subsides enough that it could eventually switch from water cooling to air cooling.\u003c/p>\u003cp>NO IMMEDIATE DANGER SEEN\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority estimates that a power outage at Chernobyl will not lead to any radiological emissions in the next couple weeks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The fuel storage ponds are also very deep and would likely take weeks for the water to boil down, even without cooling pumps active. This should hopefully allow enough time for the power to cooling systems to be restored,” said Mark Wenman, a nuclear energy expert at Imperial College London.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The IAEA, which is the U.N. nuclear watchdog based in Vienna, said it saw no critical impact on safety at Chernobyl because there could be “effective heat removal without need for electrical supply” from spent nuclear fuel at the site.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lyman and others said they were more concerned about potential damage to cooling systems and other problems at Ukraine's four other operating nuclear power plants, rather than at the defunct Chernobyl site. In 2017, Chernobyl got a new 2 billion euro containment system to go over the old sarcophagus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>OTHER CONCERNS\u003c/p>\u003cp>The post-Fukushima study did raise issues about hydrogen gas being generated and pooling from the cooling process, which is removed with an electronic system, Lyman said. The concern is that the explosive gas may pool more without the venting system and lead to dangers, including sparks when electricity is turned back on if it ever stops.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Another issue is that lack of electricity means the IAEA’s monitoring system, for safety and security, will be blinded, Lyman said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s not just the cooling to the pools, but all the off-site radiation monitoring systems have been lost,” Lyman said. “The IAEA doesn’t have cameras anymore.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>He described the overall situation as not good, but said it isn’t an immediate emergency. There are layers of safety that help, but the lack of power peels some of those away.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s limping along with kind of less resilience,” Lyman said. “So if something else does happen, there’s less margin.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Given that experts say a major radioactive release is weeks to months away, if at all, the biggest consequence of the power shutoff or targeting of nuclear plants in the war is fear, said Emma Claire Foley, a policy researcher on U.S.-Russian nuclear policy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“People hear ‘Chernobyl’ and think ‘nuclear disaster,’” Foley said. “It does cause fear. And it does cause a sense of uncertainty.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>If anything bad did happen, Ukraine's neighbor of Belarus, a Russian ally, “would need to be more concerned than anyone else” because of its proximity to the Chernobyl site, said University of Southern California nuclear engineering professor Najmedin Meshkati. The Belarus border is less than 10 miles from Chernobyl, while the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) south of the plant,\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Belarus got the brunt of the Chernobyl impact” from the radioactive cloud released in 1986, he said, adding that Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko should “take the lead in begging Mr. Putin to stop military operations around Chernobyl.”\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-science","name":"Science","canonicalName":"science","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false},{"id":"Physics","name":"Physics","canonicalName":"physics","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-WorldNews","name":"World News","canonicalName":"world-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Nuclearpower","name":"Nuclear power","canonicalName":"nuclear-power","isPr":false},{"id":"Accidents","name":"Accidents","canonicalName":"accidents","isPr":false},{"id":"UnitedNations","name":"United Nations","canonicalName":"united-nations","isPr":false},{"id":"InternationalAtomicEnergyAgency","name":"International Atomic Energy Agency","canonicalName":"international-atomic-energy-agency","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:bf2bcfb3a499d688e3075f2d4cf54989","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:bf2bcfb3a499d688e3075f2d4cf54989","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:bf2bcfb3a499d688e3075f2d4cf54989","shortId":"bf2bcfb3a499d688e3075f2d4cf54989","bylines":"By EVGENIY MALOLETKA and MSTYSLAV CHERNOV","canonicalUrl":"russia-ukraine-boris-johnson-business-europe-united-nations","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>MARIUPOL, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian airstrike on a Mariupol maternity hospital that killed three people brought condemnation down on Moscow on Thursday, with Ukrainian and Western officials branding it a war crime, while the highest-level talks yet yielded no progress in stopping the fighting.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"Attack on Ukrainian hospital draws outrage as talks stall","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"3ea596b5a45e4437a7e2744c8dc03117","leadVideoId":"67f90cc81e434aeba1f1ba682f636f0a","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/bf2bcfb3a499d688e3075f2d4cf54989","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"3ea596b5a45e4437a7e2744c8dc03117","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>A woman walks outside a maternity hospital that was damaged by shelling in Mariupol, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 9, 2022.
