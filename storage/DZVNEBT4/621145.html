 a skating rink just outside the president’s office in central Kyiv last
 week, while tourists took pictures of themselves in front of 
onion-domed, snow-dusted churches. The stores were full of people 
shopping for the New Year’s holiday and Orthodox Christmas, just as they
 always are at this time of year. The airports were crowded.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">In
 other words, nothing unusual was happening in the Ukrainian 
capital—nothing except for the contingency plans being made for a 
possible <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/">Russian invasion</a>.
 You can’t see them from the skating rink, but more than 100,000 Russian
 troops are gathered around Ukraine’s borders, along with weapons, armed
 vehicles, field hospitals, and Black Sea battleships. Quietly, 
newspaper editors are asking journalists to get their documents in 
order, just in case they suddenly need to travel to war zones. A Western
 diplomat told me that people she knows are “getting familiar with the 
concept of the ‘go bag,’” luggage that you have packed and ready in case
 of emergency. Gallows humor is everywhere. When, a few days ago, the 
Ukrainian Ministry of Defense called on women to register with the army,
 a plethora of jokes and memes made the rounds on people’s cellphones 
(this sort of thing: an image of a man lying in bed beside his wife and 
thinking, <em>When will they get on with it and mobilize her?</em>). 
People wonder out loud if the Russians will come before or after their 
planned winter vacations, and muse about whether they should change the 
dates accordingly.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">A sense of
 unreality underlies all of these conversations. This moment is 
“strange—very, very strange,” Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian 
defense minister, told me. For people in his country, the Russian threat
 is both dire and entirely unsurprising. Zagorodnyuk noted, as everybody
 in Kyiv does, that Russia <em>already</em> invaded Ukraine in early 2014. The Russians <em>already</em> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/06/some-crimeans-who-cheered-russia-have-buyers-remorse/591739/">occupy Crimea</a>, which is Ukrainian territory. Fake “separatists,” supplied with Russian weapons, <em>already</em>
 control a small piece of eastern Ukraine, where they continue to fight 
the Ukrainian army, every day of every week. Some 14,000 people, 
including both soldiers and civilians, have <em>already</em> died in a 
conflict that continues only because the Russian government wants it to 
continue. Before I even broached the subject of whether Ukraine’s armed 
forces were ready for a new offensive, Andriy Yermak, President 
Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief of staff, reminded me: “We are in a state of 
constant military preparedness now for eight years.” Precisely because 
the Ukrainians are permanently under attack from Russia, it is usually 
the Ukrainians who shout loudest and call for international attention 
when the fighting escalates, or when the Russian army conducts massive 
military exercises along their borders, as it did last spring. But not 
this time.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" class="ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__v6EBD" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/">Read our ongoing coverage of the Russian invasion in Ukraine</a></p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">This time, the alarm bells are ringing louder in Washington than in Kyiv. Secretary of State Antony Blinken <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-antony-blinken-3ee1ad846f296d2d34bd5d1c45562251">began warning European allies</a>
 about a possible new Russian invasion of Ukraine several weeks ago, and
 rumors of genuinely terrible things to come are flying around other 
Western capitals too. An invasion of Kyiv. An occupation of the country.
 The warnings seem to be based not just on the operational intelligence 
that many have seen—ominous photographs of military equipment and 
personnel accumulating around Ukraine’s borders—but on strategic 
intelligence, insights into the thinking of Kremlin insiders, which U.S.
 officials are allegedly showing their allies.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">The
 alarm bells are also ringing because of the public behavior of Russian 
diplomats and officials, including President Vladimir Putin, who have 
spent the past couple of weeks accusing the United States and its allies
 of nonexistent aggression, such as <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-us-mercenaries-plan-chemical-attack-ukraine/">imaginary plans</a>
 to use chemical weapons against Russian-backed forces in eastern 
Ukraine. In fact, the sole aggressor in the region is Russia. Russian 
troops occupy not only parts of Ukraine but also parts of Georgia and 
Moldova; Russian “advisers”—latter-day Soviet commissars—now prop up a 
violent dictator in Belarus and may be <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/belarus-russia-union-state/31446183.html">about to annex</a>
 that country too. Russian propaganda organs regularly issue violent 
threats. On New Year’s Eve, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti <a href="https://twitter.com/sumlenny/status/1476814326623260672?s=20">tweeted a prediction</a>: “Russia will destroy Ukraine within 10 minutes.”</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Yet
 Russia insists on declaring that it fears NATO, a defensive alliance 
that mostly still exists, in 2022, because so many Europeans fear 
Russia. Putin has kept up this victim act for so many years that it has 
become banal; even many Russian experts now accept this performance as 
normal. But even if he believes it himself—even if he thinks that a 
handful of American soldiers rotating in and out of Poland pose some 
kind of physical threat to Moscow—that doesn’t mean the rest of the 
world has to accommodate his paranoia. It’s as if an American president 
repeatedly demanded that Canadian troops withdraw to the Arctic Circle 
on the grounds that their presence near Detroit constituted an 
unacceptable threat, and the rest of the world murmured agreement. In 
truth, the only logical explanation for this nonsensical posturing is 
that it is designed to justify a totally unprovoked invasion of 
Ukraine—or the Baltic states, or who knows where else—sometime in the 
future, and that’s why it has people worried.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" class="ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__v6EBD" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/12/russia-putin-ukraine-invasion/621140/">Read: Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is backfiring</a></p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI ArticleParagraph_dropcap__Xra23"><span class="smallcaps">In Kyiv, </span>the
 novelty of this moment has produced, among the people I spoke with, two
 schools of thought. The skeptical school essentially thinks this whole 
situation might be a huge bluff: The Russians have deliberately set out 
to “scare the Americans,” perhaps even by leaking jazzed-up versions of 
Kremlin debates, in order to create pressure on Ukraine to change its 
constitution as the Russians would like, or to put Putin at the center 
of international attention, or to reestablish a Russian sphere of 
influence inside old Soviet borders. If this deliberately organized 
panic is a game, the skeptics say, the Russians have chalked up some 
wins. President Joe Biden has now twice held one-on-one conversations 
with Putin. A whole series of new Russian-American, Russian-NATO, and 
Russian-European security talks are scheduled for January. The tone of 
the diplomatic conversation around Ukraine has changed too. No longer 
are negotiators focused on the actual crisis in eastern Ukraine. 
Instead, the focus is on the Russian-American and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/russia-west-caucasus/620581/">Russian-NATO</a> relationships.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">So
 far, the U.S. has not yet given Putin anything else. Crucially, Biden 
and other senior administration officials have repeated several times an
 old Polish phrase, “nothing about us without us,” often used in the 
region. It means that decisions about Ukraine will not be made above the
 heads of Ukrainians. This is the only legitimate response to Putin’s 
threats, many of which are intended to achieve the opposite: get the 
U.S. to cut the Ukrainians out of the loop.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Members
 of a more pessimistic school of thought can also see that the 
saber-rattling has been carefully planned. But they fear that it 
reflects a genuine change: Perhaps Putin has finally decided to realize 
his long-standing dream of removing Ukraine from the map. Back in 2008, 
the Russian president told leaders gathered at a NATO summit that 
Ukraine is “not a state.” Last summer, he <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putins-new-ukraine-essay-reflects-imperial-ambitions/">published a long essay</a>
 arguing, among other things, that Russians and Ukrainians are “one 
people.” He then sent that essay to every soldier in the Russian army. 
Putin’s interest in invading, occupying, dividing, or otherwise 
destroying Ukraine—a country that has no nuclear weapons and could not 
invade Russia—is not strategic. It is emotional. The collapse of the 
Soviet Union was, in his words, “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe 
of the 20th century.” An expanded Russian occupation of Ukrainian 
territory might, in his view, help right that wrong.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Putin’s
 interest is also ideological. Every year, Ukraine becomes more 
confident, more united, more European. Every year, Ukraine inches a 
little bit closer to democracy and prosperity. What if it gets there? 
The idea of a flourishing, democratic Ukraine right on Russia’s doorstep
 is, for Putin, personally intolerable. Just as Ukrainian independence 
once seemed to Stalin to be a dire threat to his Bolshevik regime, so 
too would a successful modern Ukraine pose too great a challenge to 
Putin’s autocratic, sclerotic, kleptocratic, and ever more brutal 
political system. What if Russians start envying their Ukrainian 
neighbors? What if they decide they want a system like that too?</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" class="ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__v6EBD" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/12/the-autocrats-are-winning/620526/">Anne Applebaum: The bad guys are winning</a></p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">What
 the pessimists in Kyiv fear is this scenario: If Putin believes that 
Ukraine must be destroyed sooner or later; if he believes that 
historical wrongs must be righted; even if he just wants to gain back 
some of the popularity he has lost to COVID, corruption, and a poor 
economy, then he might have reasons to think that this is a good moment 
to do it. The Russians can see that the U.S. is divided, that Europe is 
exhausted by the pandemic and in need of Russian gas, that nobody is 
interested in new military adventures. They can also see that 
pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine are slowly losing ground, that 
Ukraine continues to invest in its military, and that others are doing 
so too.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Despite one very 
notable setback in Kyiv’s relationship with Washington—President Donald 
Trump tried to use military aid as a tool to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/08/trump-ukraine-call-impeachment-vindman/619617/">blackmail Zelensky</a>,
 and got impeached for it—the U.S. has continued to give Ukraine 
training and military assistance, including $450 million of defensive 
weapons this year. None of this would enable Ukraine to attack Russia, 
but it might help Ukrainians defend themselves. The Russians know this, 
and they could be calculating accordingly. One Russian analyst, Vladimir
 Frolov, <a href="https://www.colta.ru/articles/society/28961-vladimir-frolov-rossiya-ukraina-voennyy-krizis-razryadka-2-0">notes</a>
 that the costs of an invasion are steadily rising—because of Ukrainian 
economic growth, national consolidation, and military investment—and 
suggests that the price could rise more in the future, which is why 
Moscow should act now.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">The 
Ukrainians are also thinking about that price, because they want to make
 it even higher: This is a subject about which both schools of thought 
in Kyiv agree. They know their country doesn’t have much of a navy or an
 air force, and it doesn’t have the most advanced anti-aircraft defenses
 either. But Ukraine has taken steps toward the creation of a 
territorial-defense force, run by the professional military but open to 
civilian volunteers. Small groups of enthusiasts, including recent 
veterans of the eastern conflict, have already formed their own training
 units. According to a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=andrij+yermak&amp;oq=andrij+yermak&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j46i13j0i13l2j0i13i30l2j0i8i13i30.3767j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">survey conducted last spring</a>,
 about 30 percent of Ukrainians (and 46 percent of men) say that they 
are willing to join an armed battle if an invasion occurs. In an <a href="https://wyborcza.pl/magazyn/7,124059,27955075,adam-michnik-i-petro-poroszenko-w-ukrainie-forteca-stanie-sie.html">interview in the Polish press</a>,
 the former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko spelled it out clearly:
 Ukraine wants to ensure that “every city and every home becomes a 
fortress. And that thousands of coffins are sent back to Russia.”</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">The
 Ukrainian army itself is also prepared to split into smaller units, 
less easily targeted by advanced weapons. This might not stop a Russian 
bombing campaign, but that isn’t the point. The point is to make anyone 
considering a longer-term occupation think twice. As Zagorodnyuk noted, 
even the most fanatical Russian military planner must realize that once 
an invasion begins, events will spin out of control: “You don’t know how
 many people you are going to lose, how quickly you’re going to 
advance,” he said. “And you will certainly have trouble keeping control 
of anything you have invaded.”</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI ArticleParagraph_dropcap__Xra23"><span class="smallcaps">But here </span>is
 where a second gap emerges between Kyiv and Washington, as well as a 
second reason why this moment is so “very, very strange.” The 
Ukrainians, in the government and in the opposition, have no difficulty 
understanding that their conflict with Russia will involve violence, 
because it already does. Americans and Europeans, meanwhile, desperately
 want a solution involving nothing more than diplomacy and sanctions. On
 some level, Biden seems to understand that this might not be possible. 
He has publicly promised to reinforce Ukraine militarily in the event of
 an invasion, and also says he will move more arms and equipment into 
the eastern NATO states. Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, 
told me that although he is grateful for this promise, it does raise a 
question: “If Washington sees the threat is imminent, then the best time
 to give us more military support to reinforce our armed forces is now, 
not after the invasion begins.”</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">In
 fact, the best time to give Ukraine more significant military support 
would have been eight years ago. Or five years ago. Or three years ago. 
If the U.S. had done so, then there would be a lesser threat, or no 
threat, of Russian invasion now, because Putin would calculate the risks
 differently. But Americans didn’t step in, because President Barack 
Obama never took Russia seriously, because Trump was on Putin’s side in 
the global contest between autocracy and democracy, and because 
Democrats and Republicans alike have had other things to think about 
since Biden took office.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">As a
 nation, the U.S. has also started to forget the most important 
strategic lesson of the Cold War: Deterrence works. The idea that you 
invest in weapons in order to create peace has always sounded 
paradoxical, but decades of stability in Europe, thanks to both the 
creation of NATO in the 1950s and the expansion of NATO in the 1990s, 
prove this to be true. If you share a land mass with a bully, then make 
sure you are well armed enough to keep him at a safe distance.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Seen
 from Kyiv, the Western attitude toward Russia also looks incredibly 
naive. Since the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008, Americans and 
Europeans have constantly been surprised by Russia, by Russian 
aggression, by Russian territorial ambitions, by Russian interference in
 our own political systems, by Russian attempts to destroy our 
alliances. But although Putin varies his tactics, his longer-term goals 
have been very clear for a very long time. He might use disinformation 
one year, gas-pipeline blackmail another, bribery or violence the next, 
but the endgame is always the same: reinforce his autocracy, undermine 
democracies—all democracies—and push Russian political influence as far 
as it will go. Break up NATO. Destroy the European Union. Remove 
American influence from Europe and everywhere else, forever.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Americans
 need to stop being surprised by this list of goals, and instead start 
writing a list of our own. We could start with this one: Help make 
Ukraine the successful, prosperous, Western-facing democracy that Putin 
so clearly fears. Don’t make decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. 
And don’t do these things because it’s nice for the children at the 
ice-skating rink in Kyiv—do them because, in this case, Putin’s analysis
 is not paranoid: A successful, prosperous, Western-facing democratic 
Ukraine would indeed pose a dire ideological threat to Russia, as well 
as to Belarus and to other autocracies in the region and around the 
world. It would prove to the inhabitants of other autocracies that they <em>can</em>
 escape the influence of their greedy, brutal leaders. Losing Ukraine, 
by contrast, would reinforce dictators in Moscow, Minsk, and even 
Beijing.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Biden has said he 
wants to “prove that American democracy can still do big things and take
 on challenges that matter most.” Mostly, he means domestic challenges. 
But some challenges abroad will also affect American confidence and 
credibility well into the future. Helping Ukrainians defend Ukrainian

If this deliberately organized panic is a game, the skeptics say, the Russians have chalked up some wins. President Joe Biden has now twice held one-on-one conversations with Putin. A whole series of new Russian-American, Russian-NATO, and Russian-European security talks are scheduled for January. The tone of the diplomatic conversation around Ukraine has changed too. No longer are negotiators focused on the actual crisis in eastern Ukraine.
