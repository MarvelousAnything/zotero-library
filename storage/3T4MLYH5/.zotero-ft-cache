Abstract: Using a large dataset compiled from studies over the years covering 23 tree species, we developed methods to estimate total and components (stem, bark, branch, and foliage) of aboveground live tree biomass. Missing components in the dataset were imputed using species-speciﬁc or generalized (species combined into softwood and hardwood groups) Dirichlet imputation. Geometric means of the imputed stem wood proportions were 8% and 9% higher than the observed geometric mean of stem wood proportions in softwood and hardwood species, respectively. For other components, the differences were within 1%. On average, the component ratio method (CRM), used for the ofﬁcial United States forest carbon inventories, underestimated the aboveground biomass (AGB, kg) predictions by 3.7% with a very wide range (–70.3% to 31.6%). Compared with the CRM approach, equations developed in this study reduced RMSE of AGB by as much as 145.0%. On average, new equations reduced RMSE in predicting individual-tree AGB by 15.5% compared with the CRM approach and by 3.9% compared with a calibration of CRM AGB. Predicting AGB as a function of stem volume was not as accurate as using direct AGB equations. Generalized component ratio equations may be suitable for the stem wood component but were highly biased for other components.

Résumé : À l’aide d’un important jeu de données compilées à partir d’études couvrant plusieurs années et 23 espèces d’arbres, nous avons élaboré des méthodes pour estimer la biomasse aérienne totale et ses composantes (fût, écorce, branches et feuillage) chez les arbres vivants. Les composantes manquantes dans le jeu de données ont été imputées en utilisant la méthode de Dirichlet individuellement pour chaque espèce ou collectivement en formant un groupe pour les espèces résineuses et un autre pour les espèces feuillues. Les moyennes géométriques imputées des proportions de bois de fût étaient respectivement 8 et 9 % plus élevées que les moyennes géométriques observées des proportions de bois de fût chez les espèces résineuses et feuillues. Dans le cas des autres composantes, les différences étaient en deçà de 1 %. En moyenne, la méthode des ratios des composantes (MRC), utilisée pour les inventaires ofﬁciels du carbone forestier aux États-Unis, sous-estimait les prédictions de biomasse aérienne (BA, kg) de 3,7 % avec un très grand écart (–70,3 à 31,6 %). Comparativement à la MRC, les équations élaborées dans cette étude ont réduit l’erreur quadratique moyenne (EQM) de la BA jusqu’à 145,0 %. En moyenne, les nouvelles équations pour prédire la BA d’arbres individuels ont réduit l’EQM de 15,5 % comparativement à la MRC, et de 3,9 % comparativement à une calibration de la BA par la MRC. La prédiction de la BA en fonction du volume du fût n’était pas aussi précise que l’utilisation directe des équations de la BA. Les équations généralisées du ratio des composantes peuvent convenir pour la composante du bois de fût mais elles étaient fortement biaisées pour les autres composantes. [Traduit par la Rédaction]

Introduction
Forest biomass is important commercially for fuelwood and ﬁber production and scientiﬁcally for studies of ecosystem productivity (Parresol 1999). It is also useful in quantifying carbon stocks and sequestration rates, assessing potential impacts due to climate change, locating bio-energy processing plants, and mapping and planning fuel treatments (Temesgen et al. 2015). The ofﬁcial United States (US) forest carbon inventories rely on tree aboveground biomass (AGB) predictions from sample tree measurements and forest area estimates of the USDA Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program (Heath et al. 2009).
The amount of biomass as living vegetation or dead wood and debris is an important factor that determines forest function in regulating atmospheric carbon (Brown 2002). An estimated 296 Gt

of carbon is contained in above- and below-ground forest biomass (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) 2016). However, growth rates, harvest activities, natural disturbances such as wildﬁre, and loss of forest cover due to land-use changes can alter the carbon stocks and carbon-ﬁxing ability of a forest. Thus, the potential contribution of forest ecosystems in meeting a variety of human goals requires good information on current and future biomass predictions.
Estimates of component biomass are important because of the different roles that they play in forest management. Crown biomass estimates are useful in assessing fuel load, formulating ﬁre management strategies, and developing wildﬁre models. Knowledge of biomass present in small branches, leaves, and bark is useful when assessing the feasibility of bioenergy plant establish-

ment. Because direct measurement of biomass involves destructive sampling of the subject tree, allometric equations that estimate the biomass of tree components based on standing tree dendrometric variables are used. One of the desirable properties in ﬁtting component biomass equations is that the sum of the predicted component biomass is the same as the total biomass obtained from the equation for AGB. In recent decades, this property was attained by ﬁtting a constrained simultaneous system of equations using seemingly unrelated regression (e.g., Parresol 1999). Recently, component biomass has been predicted as the product of predicted total biomass and the component proportion has been predicted from generalized linear models such as Dirichlet regression (Poudel and Temesgen 2016a; Zhao et al. 2016; Dahlhausen et al. 2017), multinomial logistic regression (Poudel and Temesgen 2016a), or a fractional multinomial logit regression (Zhao et al. 2016).
The type and amount of data and the number of equations required to accurately quantify biomass is unknown. When predicting biomass at the local scale, site- and species-speciﬁc equations might be preferred to regional equations in their current form. Additionally, locally developed species-speciﬁc biomass equations may provide biomass estimates that are considerably different from the estimates obtained by using regional biomass equations without local calibration. On the other hand, generalized equations calibrated with location-speciﬁc best unbiased linear predictors based on small sample sizes can perform better than ﬁtting location-speciﬁc equations based on much larger samples (de-Miguel et al. 2014). Another alternative is to directly include stand variables that are correlated with difference between local equations (e.g., Wirth et al. 2004; Forrester et al. 2017).
There have been multiple efforts to develop national-scale biomass estimators in the US and other countries. Jenkins et al. (2003) developed national-scale biomass equations based on metaanalysis of the compiled diameter-based equations. The resulting equations use diameter at breast height (DBH) as the only predictor of total AGB and were the basis of the US forest carbon inventories until 2009. Using the allometric equation form adopted by Jenkins et al. (2003), biomass increases with DBH (Heath et al. 2009) without any accounting for variation in stem form or height (Zhou and Hemstrom 2009). In 2009, the FIA updated its biomass prediction models by switching to a method known as the component ratio method (CRM) to estimate biomass of medium and large trees (Woodall et al. 2011). The CRM was proposed for consistent national biomass estimation based on FIA volume estimates with conversion and expansion factors for determining whole-tree and component biomass. One drawback of the CRM is its use of regional volume equations, which results in different volume and biomass estimates for trees of the same species, diameter, and height where they exist across regional boundaries (Heath et al. 2009). In addition, Domke et al. (2012) found that this attempt to balance accuracy with consistency resulted in an average decrease of 16% in national carbon stock estimates for the 20 most abundant tree species in the 48 conterminous US states.
The literature on aboveground biomass estimation is voluminous. Early biomass studies were focused on ﬁtting small-scale site- and species-speciﬁc allometric equations, while recent studies have focused more on ﬁtting techniques and application of remote sensing techniques. Use of remote sensing technology to monitor forest resources over time has also gained substantial momentum in recent years due to its ability to cover larger spatial extents compared with ground-based measurements (e.g., Jucker et al. 2017); however, the accuracy of such methods is still uncertain in comparison with the ground-based measurements, making them unsuitable for some applications (Poudel et al. 2018). Large-scale biomass studies based on remotely sensed data usually use estimates from one of the prevailing methods and equations such as the CRM or those developed by Jenkins et al. (2003) applied to ground-truth plots as the observed true value of biomass. The

accuracy of the remotely sensed estimates is seldom tested against observed biomass data obtained from destructive sampling. Instead, the estimates obtained from these methods have been compared with one another.
Recently, Radtke et al. (2017) performed a large-scale biomass study covering 33 states in the eastern US with a collection of tree measurement data compiled from studies conducted over the past 115 years. They compared carbon and biomass estimates obtained from the current CRM approach with the estimates obtained from six different modiﬁcations of CRM, as well as the estimates obtained from a new ﬁt of the AGB equations. The CRM in its present formulation underestimated AGB in eastern forests, with the range of underestimation varying from 6.2% to 17% depending on the species tested. An approach that replaced stem volume, sapling AGB, and component ratio equations resulted in the greatest reduction in estimation bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) in their study.
Two main issues surface when combining data obtained from different biomass studies: (i) component deﬁnition — components of AGB may be deﬁned differently in different studies; and (ii) missing components — one or more biomass components could be missing in some studies. While there is not much that one can do with inconsistent variable deﬁnitions unless additional information is also reported in the past studies, there are methods for addressing missing components. Missing data are usually handled by complete-case analysis, i.e., by using trees that have data for all components; however, this can result in severe loss of information in the multivariate case (Hron et al. 2010).
Imputation methods have been successfully demonstrated as a way to ﬁll in missing values to make better use of available information (Hron et al. 2010). Both univariate and multivariate imputations, as well as single and multiple imputations, have been used in forestry. Vonderach et al. (2018) used multiple imputation to ﬁll in the missing biomass components to develop consistent sets of additive biomass equations for eight tree species in Germany; however, the imputed values from multiple imputation do not ensure the desired additive property unless it is assumed that the sum of the imputed component biomasses is the implied total biomass. Biomass components are compositional data as they are positive real numbers with a unit sum. Because the compositional data are represented in the simplex sample space rather than in the Euclidean space, the loss of information by using complete case analysis is even more severe (Hron et al. 2010). In other words, their sample space is the sample space of D-part compositions deﬁned as

where D represents the number of components and d = D – 1. With data similar to that of Radtke et al. (2017), we assessed the
accuracy of the CRM approach for 23 tree species from 10 states in the western US. New sets of volume, AGB, and component biomass equations were developed. Missing values of the components of AGB were recovered by using an imputation method. The goal was to identify whether the calibration of existing model predictions or ﬁtting new models of AGB and component biomass would improve on the accuracy of existing methods currently in use. Speciﬁcally, the objectives of this study were to (i) assess the performance of Dirichlet imputation in predicting missing component biomass, (ii) ﬁt equations to predict total stem cubic volume (cubic volume total stem (CVTS), m3), (iii) evaluate the error produced by the CRM in estimating AGB, and (iv) develop new approaches to estimate AGB and component biomass and evaluate their performance against the existing methods.

Materials and methods
Data Radtke et al. (2015) compiled a large collection of taper, volume,
biomass, and wood density data from North American trees destructively sampled over the past century. The collection included stem volume records from 15 485 trees and AGB records from 1815 trees from the western US (Table 1). Data used in this study came from 10 western US states (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Montana, and Colorado) from 23 tree species. Figure 1 shows the approximate locations where the sample trees were harvested. Many of the AGB records were separated into four major aboveground components — stem wood, stem bark, branches (wood and bark), and foliage — although some component measurements were unaccounted for in a number of sample trees (Fig. 2). Species groupings following Jenkins et al. (2003) were adopted to accommodate species with very small sample sizes (n < 9). Note that the choice of species grouping is completely arbitrary and that there are many other possibilities such as grouping by species functional traits, grouping by taxa, and speciﬁc gravity as done by Chojnacky et al. (2014).
Missing components were imputed using Dirichlet imputation by species or species groups. The Euclidean distance, squared Euclidean distance, and Mahalanobis distance are the commonly used distance metrics in the univariate imputations, but they are not appropriate for compositional data such as biomass components because the compositional data are represented in the simplex sample space rather than in the Euclidean space (Hron et al. 2010). Dirichlet imputation uses the Aitchison distance to impute missing components. The Aitchison distance for two compositions x = (x1, x2, …, xD)T and y = (y1, y2, …, yD)T is deﬁned as

Dirichlet imputation requires at least some individuals with all components measured. For species missing any component observations on all trees, the imputation was performed at the speciesgroup level. Dirichlet imputation was implemented with R function impCoda in library robCompositions (Templ et al. 2011). Dirichlet imputation results in different values than the actual values for the observed components; however, the original values can be recovered with a simple calculation:

where pˆ cj is the recovered proportion of component c on tree j; pcj is the observed or imputed proportion of component c on tree j; SOj is the sum of observed proportions of non-missing components for tree j; and SIj is the sum of imputed proportions of non-missing components for tree j. For a tree with no missing components, SOj = SIj = 1 and therefore pˆ cj ϭ pcj.
Methods
Component ratio method CRM is a multistep process that involves converting sound vol-
ume of wood in the merchantable stem (30 cm from the ground to a 10.2 cm inside-bark diameter top) using a compiled set of wood speciﬁc gravities. Biomass in stem bark is calculated using a set of percent bark and bark speciﬁc gravities compiled by Miles and Smith (2009). Biomass of stump wood and bark is based on volume

equations in Raile (1982) together with a compiled set of wood and bark speciﬁc gravities and bark percent coefﬁcients. Biomass of non-merchantable top and limbs is calculated by subtracting biomass of merchantable stem and foliage obtained using Jenkins et al. (2003) equations and CRM estimated stump biomass from the total AGB obtained using Jenkins et al. (2003) equations and

multiplying by the CRM adjustment factor. Total AGB is obtained by summing these component masses.

units: Northern, Southern, Interior West, and Paciﬁc Northwest.

The CRM uses species-speciﬁc merchantable volume equations, some of which vary within and between FIA unit and subunit (Woodall et al. 2011). The merchantable stem volumes serve as the starting point for biomass conversion and expansion to AGB and other components. As a result, biomass estimates for trees of identical species, diameter, and height may differ based on their geographic locales.
The same regional volume equations provide estimates of wood volume from ground to tip. Exploratory data analysis showed a nonlinear relationship between DBH and CVTS, as well as between total tree height (HT) and CVTS. Therefore, a nonlinear equation in the form of eq. 3 was ﬁtted by species without regard to geographic location:
(3) y ϭ exp[␤0 ϩ ␤1 ln(DBH) ϩ ␤2 ln(HT)] ϩ ␧

where y is the CVTS, ␤0, ␤1, and ␤2 are the regression parameters to be estimated from the data, and ␧ is the random error.

New AGB equations Different linear and nonlinear models with varying predictor
variables were examined to predict AGB. The predictors of AGB included DBH, HT, and their transformations. When a model was ﬁtted with the log-transformation of the dependent variable, i.e., ln(AGB), the predicted values were obtained by multiplying the log-bias correction factor (CF) introduced by Baskerville (1972):

MSE 2

where MSE is the mean squared error obtained by the leastsquares regression.
Calibration of CRM estimated AGB Poudel and Temesgen (2016b) used regression-based calibration
factors to calibrate regional volume and component biomass equations. Poudel et al. (2018) used a similar approach to calibrate volume and biomass change estimated using multi-temporal lidar sampling and re-measured ﬁeld inventory data. In this study, calibrated CRM estimates of AGB were developed from the CRM-

estimated AGB using calibration coefﬁcients obtained from ﬁtting a simple linear regression model of the following form:
(5) ln(AGBi) ϭ ␣ ϩ ␤ ln(AGB_CRMi) ϩ ␧i

where AGBi is the observed AGB of tree i from destructive sampling or legacy studies, AGB_CRMi is the CRM-estimated AGB of tree i, ␣ and ␤ are the parameters in the linear regression, and ␧i is the random error. Then, with the least squares estimators a and b
of ␣ and ␤, respectively, the corresponding calibration equation is

(6)

Aˆ GBi ϭ CF × exp[a ϩ b ln(AGBCRMi)]

Thus, for the future observations, if one obtains AGB_CRMi as the regional predicted value of biomass, the unknown value AGBi for the new tree can be estimated using eq. 6. Once again, CF is the multiplicative log-bias correction factor as deﬁned in eq. 4. Note that the calibration coefﬁcients, as well as the evaluation statistics, were obtained based on a 500-case resampling.
Volume-to-biomass conversion The volume-to-biomass conversion factor for merchantable
stem wood in the CRM is speciﬁc gravity, i.e., merchantable stem wood biomass = sg × Vmerch, where sg is the wood speciﬁc gravity and Vmerch is the merchantable wood volume. Radtke et al. (2017) achieved greatest reduction in estimation bias and RMSE of AGB by using whole-stem volume instead of merchantable volume. They converted the total stem cubic volume (CVTS) to whole-stem biomass by applying either species-speciﬁc speciﬁc gravity compiled by Miles and Smith (2009) or the observed speciﬁc gravity depending on the modeling scenario used.
In this study, we ﬁtted simple linear regression models that converted whole-stem volume to total AGB. To add ﬂexibility in converting stem volume to AGB, we included both slope and intercept in the regression model.

where Cˆ VTS is the cubic volume including top and stump obtained by using eq. 3 ﬁtted in this study.

Component biomass estimation Biomass in different components can be estimated in different
ways, e.g., as a ratio of other components (e.g., the CRM approach), by ﬁtting independent equations for component proportions (e.g., beta regression in Poudel and Temesgen 2016a), ﬁtting a simultaneous system of component biomass equations (e.g., Parresol 1999), or ﬁtting a simultaneous system of equations for component proportions (e.g., Dirichlet regression in Poudel and Temesgen 2016a). We used the Dirichlet regression to estimate the proportion of biomass in different aboveground components. The Dirichlet regression treats the aboveground biomass as compositional data and follows a Dirichlet distribution. Details of the Dirichlet regression are given in Poudel and Temesgen (2016a).

Evaluation Accuracy of the CRM, as well as the new methods in estimating
AGB, were compared for the study dataset using bias, bias percent, RMSE, and RMSE percent deﬁned as follows:

where yi and yˆi are observed and predicted biomass in tree i, respectively, and y¯ is the average biomass of n trees. These evaluation statistics for AGB estimation were obtained at each iteration of a 500-case resampling and averaged to obtain the ﬁnal evaluation statistics.
Bias reﬂects how close the functional form of the model can get to the true relationship between the dependent and independent variables (Kuhn and Johnson 2013). RMSE gives more weight to the large but infrequent errors than the mean. Results from the model with high RMSE will signiﬁcantly change the model ﬁt with small deviations in the data (Kuhn and Johnson 2013). In addition, the RMSE penalizes models with large prediction errors. In general, bias in estimating equations should be avoided as much as possible. RMSE can be high due to natural variation in the population, but prediction equations with lower RMSE are more precise and thus more desirable. All statistical procedures were performed in R statistical software (version 3.4.4; R Core Team 2018).
We used these statistics to evaluate four approaches to estimate AGB and two approaches to estimate components of AGB. Approaches to estimate AGB are (i) current CRM, (ii) use of direct AGB equations ﬁtted in this study, (iii) calibration of CRM-estimated AGB, and (iv) conversion of predicted CVTS to AGB using volumeto-biomass conversion equations. Approaches to estimate components of AGB are (i) generalized component ratio equations for hardwood and softwood species and (ii) species-speciﬁc component ratio equations obtained with Dirichlet regression. We would like to note that the grouping into hardwood and softwood to obtain generalized biomass equations may not be the best grouping (e.g., Ducey 2012; Forrester et al. 2017), but we used this grouping as it is used in the current CRM approach and the

national-scale estimation technique developed by Jenkins et al. (2003).
Results
Imputation and CVTS modeling The greatest differences (up to 9.2%) in the imputed and ob-
served geometric means of component proportions were observed in imputing the stem wood component. The number of observations available for component biomass for each species is shown in Fig. 2, and geometric means of the observed and imputed component biomass proportions obtained using speciesspeciﬁc imputation are shown in Fig. 3. The maximum difference between observed and imputed geometric means was 9.2% (western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) stem wood component).
Of the 27 species in the original dataset, only 16 species had information on all four biomass components, two species had information on three components, six species had information on two components, and three species had only one component. As mentioned before, the Dirichlet imputation requires all components to have some observed values, but some species in our dataset had one or more components with no observed values, e.g., no crown (branch and foliage) biomass information was available for western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don (THPL); Fig. 2). Missing components in such cases were imputed using combined species data for softwood and hardwood species groups. The imputed geometric means are compared with the observed geometric means in Fig. 4. Similar to the species-speciﬁc imputations, the highest discrepancy was observed in stem wood biomass. The imputed geometric means were 8% and 9% higher than the observed geometric mean of stem wood proportions in softwood and hardwood species, respectively. For other components, the differences were within 1%.
Species-speciﬁc simple nonlinear equations with DBH and HT as predictor variables (eq. 3) were suitable for predicting CVTS inside bark (nonlinear R2 ≥ 0.96). Parameter estimates of the nonlinear inside-bark CVTS equation ﬁtted in this study are given in Table 2. Parameters of all of the models were statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level of signiﬁcance (p values <0.05). These volume equations were used to obtain CVTS-based estimates of AGB.
AGB estimation Applying the current CRM approach to estimate AGB for the
data used in this study indicated substantial bias and RMSE (Table 3). Percent bias ranged from –70.3% to 31.6%, with a positive overall bias across species averaging 3.7%. Overall average bias, however, might be misleading as the range of bias is so high (–70.3% to 31.6%). This is reﬂected in the RMSE, which ranged from 12.6% to 178.4%, with an overall average of 36.9%. In addition, the standard deviations of bias and RMSE were 22.4 and 33.0, respectively. The CRM produced the largest bias (–70.3%) and RMSE (178.4%) for Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma (Torr.) Little).
Equation forms along with their parameter estimates for the AGB equations ﬁtted in this study are presented in Table 4. Even though the form of the prediction equation is same for all species, estimation of parameters was done either through linear or nonlinear least squares approach. Species for which the nonlinear model was used have a log-bias correction factor (CF) equal to 1.0000 in Table 4. The log-bias correction factor for logarithmic models ranged from 1.0089 to 1.0356. Bias in predicting total AGB by ﬁtting new equations ranged from –2.7% for singleleaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla Torr. & Frém.) to 7.2% for giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindl.) J. Buchholz), with an overall mean across species of 0.9% (SD = 2.7%; Table 4). RMSE ranged from 7.1% for grand ﬁr (Abies grandis (Douglas ex D. Don) Lindl.) to 40.3%, for giant sequoia, with a mean of 21% (SD = 8.8%; Table 4).

racy. Calibration of the CRM using simple linear regression reduced RMSE by as much as 126.5% (for Utah juniper). On average, calibration of CRM reduced RMSE in estimating individual-tree AGB by 11.7% (SD = 26.6%). Compared with the CRM approach, new equations reduced RMSE for all species. RMSE in AGB was reduced by as much as 145.0% (for Utah juniper) by using new equations ﬁtted in this study. The smallest reduction in RMSE was observed in Douglas-ﬁr (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco; 0.7% reduction). On average, new equations reduced RMSE in estimating individual-

tree AGB by 15.5% (SD = 29.3%) compared with the CRM approach and by 3.9% (SD = 6.4%) compared with the calibration of CRM.
We ﬁtted volume-to-biomass equations using predicted CVTS from volume equations ﬁtted in this study as the predictor of the AGB (eq. 7). Coefﬁcients for volume-based AGB prediction equations are given in Table 6. When there were no data for ﬁtting species-speciﬁc volume-to-biomass equations, coefﬁcients were obtained from species group speciﬁc volume-to-biomass equations. RMSEs were obtained only for species that had both volume and biomass data.
Component biomass estimation Jenkins et al. (2003) ﬁtted two sets of generalized component
ratio equations for softwood and hardwood trees as a function of DBH. These equations are used to estimate the component ratios in the CRM approach, as well as the total AGB. We ﬁtted generalized component ratio equations simultaneously with Dirichlet regression and used both DBH and height as the predictors. Parameter estimates and their standard errors for softwood and hardwood species groups obtained from Dirichlet regression ﬁt are given in Table 7. These coefﬁcients were applied to the total AGB estimated using equations ﬁtted in this study to obtain biomass in different components.
All-species mean bias for stem wood was –1.4% (SD = 10.6%), with individual-species bias ranging from –20.2% to 28.6% (Table 8). Seven of 23 species had bias greater than 10% for the stem wood component. RMSE for stem wood ranged from 4.8% to 32.6%, with an all-species average of 16.6%. Bias and RMSE were higher for other components, with all-species average biases of –17.2% (range –72.8% to 27.7%), 1.2% (range –167.8% to 43.3%), and –19.0% (range –249.1% to 38.0%) for bark, branch, and foliage components, respectively, and all-species average RMSEs of 44.2% (range 19.5% to 94.6%), 47.6% (range 22.1% to 190.3%), and 67.7% (range 25.5% to 326.0%) for bark, branch, and foliage components, respectively.

stantially by using species-speciﬁc component ratio equations, as was expected (Table 9). Bias in stem wood was less than 2% for all species, with an average of 0.5% (range 0.0% to 1.7%) and average RMSE of 11.4% (range 2.3% to 18.5%). Similar to the generalized component ratio equations, bias and RMSE were comparatively higher for other components. Average biases for bark, branch, and foliage were –3.9% (range –17.5% to 2.5%), 0.9% (range –1.7% to 7.9%), and –1.8% (range –17.5% to 3.6%), respectively, and average

RMSEs were 25.0% (range 6.5% to 59.4%), 27.4% (range 3.4% to 48.2%), and 39% (range 13.5% to 82.4%) for bark, branch, and foliage components, respectively.

ments along with biomass equations. Therefore, large-scale forest biomass estimation is important to assess the role of the forestry sector in mitigating climate change impacts. In this study, we used “legacy” data (Radtke et al. 2015) compiled from different studies over the years to estimate total aboveground live tree biomass, as well as the biomasses of different tree components.
Accuracy of imputing component proportions was assessed by comparing observed and imputed geometric means because the closed geometric mean is the best linear unbiased estimator with respect to the geometry of the simplex of the center of the distribution of a random composition (Pawlowsky-Glahn and Egozcue 2002), and the easiest way to impute missing values in compositional data is to replace the missing values of a component by the geometric mean of available data for that component (Hron et al. 2010). Some other problems in biomass studies include purposeful selection of trees, lack of measurement of the basic variables such as height and crown width, and different ﬁeld and lab procedures

used in different studies, as they lead to different errors in measurements of AGB and CVTS from different felled tree studies.
The CRM underestimated AGB for trees used in this study dataset. This result is consistent with the results reported in Radtke et al. (2017), who found a 12.2% underestimation by the current CRM approach for eastern trees. Predictor variables for AGB in newly ﬁtted models included DBH and HT, with logarithmic and quadratic terms used as transformations that varied by species. Even though the form of the prediction equation is same for all species, estimation of parameters was done through either a linear or nonlinear least squares approach. Of special interest were subalpine ﬁr (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson & C. Lawson). In the case of subalpine ﬁr, HT, not the logarithm of HT, was statistically significant when it appeared with the logarithm of DBH in the model. For ponderosa pine, the residual vs. ﬁtted values showed a curved pattern when the independent variables were logarithms of DBH and HT (Fig. 5, left), suggesting a nonlinear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The diagnostic plot was much improved when the squared logarithm of DBH, i.e., [ln(DBH)]2, was added to the model (Fig. 5, right). We investigated different model forms and weighting schemes before settling on this model form. Residual analysis did not show any problems with the model ﬁts for other species.
Both positive and negative biases were produced by the new AGB equations developed in this study. The higher bias and RMSE produced for giant sequoia could potentially be attributed to the larger values of DBH, HT, and AGB for this species (Table 1). Average DBH, HT, and AGB for giant sequoia were 390.7 cm, 69.7 m, and 145 619.2 kg, respectively, whereas average DBH, HT, and AGB for other species were 44.3 cm, 21.0 m, and 7929.0 kg, respectively. Additionally, relatively higher bias (4.9%) was observed for redwood trees (Sequoia sempervirens (Lamb. ex D. Don) Endl.), which also have larger DBH, HT, and AGB compared with other species. However, this was not the case for Utah juniper (JUOS) and west-

We calibrated the CRM AGB estimates by ﬁtting a calibration equation based on simple linear regression (eq. 5). Poudel and Temesgen (2016b) found substantial reduction in bias and RMSE

by adjusting volume and biomass obtained from the regional equations with the calibration coefﬁcients obtained from simple linear regression. It was expected that the new ﬁt would provide the best results followed by the calibrated and uncalibrated CRM, respectively. For some species, the calibration did not reduce bias

and RMSE, e.g., it increased RMSE by 11.3% for Douglas-ﬁr trees. This could be because, in the CRM system, regional variation in Douglas-ﬁr AGB might have been accounted for by using regional merchantable volume equations while the calibration was not optimized to account for regional variation in Douglas-ﬁr biomass.
Many national forest inventories are primarily designed for the estimation of growing stock volume, with estimates of biomass and carbon obtained as secondary products (Radtke et al. 2017). Sample data for development of volume and taper equations are much more abundant than biomass data. Additionally, estimation of the stem wood component in CRM is based on merchantable stem wood volume. Volume-based AGB prediction was not as accurate as the prediction of AGB using direct AGB equations for most of the species, which was expected because of the multistep nature of this approach and the error associated in the volume prediction. Volume-based AGB estimation can be viewed as the conversion of CVTS to AGB and was expected to perform worse than the calibration of CRM-estimated AGB; however, it performed better than the calibration of CRM AGB for 7 out of 16 species (Tables 5 and 6).
Accuracy of the generalized component ratios was generally quite low and highly variable for individual components of biomass (Table 8). Large values of bias and RMSE were observed in two cases: (i) when the number of observations is less than 20 (e.g., grand ﬁr) and (ii) when the component biomass is proportionally very small (e.g., giant sequoia, redwood, and red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.)). Compared with the generalized component ratio equations for softwood and hardwood trees, bias and RMSE were reduced substantially by using species-speciﬁc component ratio equations, as was expected (Table 9). One possible reason for poor performance of the generalized component ratio models could be inherent on how the species are grouped. We graphically investigated potential grouping of species by plotting standardized coefﬁcients of the species-speciﬁc biomass equations; however, we did not observe any discernible and consistent pattern in them (Fig. 6).
Three possibilities were tested for obtaining AGB: (i) as a function of predicted CVTS, i.e., predict CVTS using eq. 2 and coefﬁcients in Table 2 and convert it to AGB using eq. 7 and coefﬁcients in Table 6; (ii) as a function of CRM AGB, i.e., predict AGB using eq. 6 and coefﬁcients in Table 5; and (iii) using direct AGB equa-

tions ﬁtted in this study, i.e., using equations in Table 4. We found that the use of direct biomass equations is most appropriate when the objective is to obtain accurate estimate of AGB. This makes sense from a statistical perspective as well because this approach minimizes the error in our variable of interest — AGB. Component biomass can be obtained by multiplying the AGB obtained from one of the three approaches by the generalized component ratio equations (Table 7) or the species-speciﬁc component ratio equations (Supplementary Table 11). When possible, the use of species-speciﬁc equations is suggested as they are notably more accurate than the generalized component ratio equations.
Conclusions
We used species-speciﬁc and generalized (when enough observations were not available in each component) Dirichlet imputation to ﬁll in the missing biomass components. The imputed geometric means were up to 9% higher than the observed geometric means of stem wood proportion, but for other components, the differences were within 1%. The CRM underestimated the AGB with very wide range across species. Results obtained from the calibration of CRM using simple linear regression were intermediate between the CRM approach and new equations. Compared with the CRM approach, new equations reduced RMSE for all species. RMSE in AGB was reduced by as much as 145.0% by using new equations ﬁtted in this study. The smallest reduction in RMSE was observed in Douglas-ﬁr (0.7% reduction). As expected, the volume-based AGB prediction was not as accurate as the prediction of AGB using direct AGB equations for most of the species; however, it performed better than the calibration of CRM AGB for 7 out of 16 species. Our results showed that generalized component ratio equations may be suitable for the stem wood component but were highly biased for other components. In addition, large bias and RMSE were observed for species with a small number of observations and for components with very small proportions of the total. As expected, the species-speciﬁc component ratio equations were more accurate than the generalized component ratio equations.
Results suggest that calibration of existing biomass equations is not sufﬁcient compared with the new ﬁt. In addition, biomass components are better estimated on a species-speciﬁc basis rather than by arbitrary grouping. Graphical comparison of standard-

ized coefﬁcients of species-speciﬁc aboveground biomass equations developed in this study did not provide a discernible pattern in them. However, a more biological rather than a purely statistical approach considering ecological strata and species functional traits or a spatially driven approach could be of interest to a larger audience. Therefore, we recommend that future studies in largescale biomass estimation should consider species grouping by taxonomic association, functional traits, and spatial distribution to account for limited species-speciﬁc data. There may be opportunities in improving modeling approaches such as path evaluation, i.e., predicting total and disaggregating into components versus predicting components and aggregating to obtain total biomass, consideration of optimal weighting schemes, and crossvalidation methods. A comprehensive analysis with the data from the entire US, including geographic and ecological parameters and species as random effects in the biomass equations, is underway.
