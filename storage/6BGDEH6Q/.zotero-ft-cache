Abstract

In this paper, a particular type of a system of generalized Volterra equations [1], whose solutions are assured to be nonnegative for arbitrary nonnegative initial values, is considered. The extended stability theorem of LaSalle is used for deriving conditions for a nonnegative equilibrium point to be stable with respect to a certain subset of the Euclidean space. The obtained stability theorem has a close relation with Lyapunov's stability condition for linear systems with constant coefficients and is generally less restrictive than conditions known so far.
