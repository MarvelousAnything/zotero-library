U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said diplomatic efforts in lead up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had stood no chance, and that President Vladimir Putin’s war was now “sinking further into a sordid campaign of war crimes and unthinkable violence against civilians.”

Writing in the New York Times, Johnson said the conflict would not become a NATO one, and reiterated the military alliance would not send troops in. NATO is seeking to prevent war potentially spilling outside Ukraine’s borders or being drawn into the conflict inside the country despite President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s repeated calls for a no-fly zone.
