IB EXAMS ARE
COMING

As you start organizing your notes (hahahaha)…
Here are the unit questions and themes IB expects of you for each unit.
Suggestions of ways to study:
1. Set aside 10-15 minutes every other day to look at the questions on the following slide and scribble notes to yourself that answer the questions. What cases and theorists can you include when answering them?
2. Review theories and theoretical foundations 3. Use the organizer to recall cases 4. …I know you’ll hate it, but flexing with more paper 2 essay practice will help
you a lot. I’ll give you several more, but none will be graded until after spring break. (And remember the AW conversion is kind, so please don’t worry about your grade for me.) 5. You can see all dates in the Week Ahead.

Unit 1: Power, Sovereignty, and International Relations

Unit 2: Human Rights (AW does units out of order, FYI- although I like this
method better)

Unit 3: Development

Unit 4: Peace and Conflict
