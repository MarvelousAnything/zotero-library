Abstract 
 
Cover : RNA isolation is routinely carried out in many laboratories around the world for numerous downstream applications. In this issue, Oñate-Sánchez and Verdonk describe a robust method for RNA isolation from multiple species. The approach, termed the Citrate-Citric Acid RNA-isolation (CiAR) method, is fast and efficient, and requires only two home-made simple, inexpensive, and non-toxic buffers. These buffers, which contain citric acid and its sodium salt, give the method its name.
