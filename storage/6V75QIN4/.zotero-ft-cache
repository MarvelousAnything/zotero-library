Biomass calculators 
 
The biomass calculator User Guide provides a decision key to help you select the right tool for your biomass estimation task and provides guidance on how to use the various tools. 
 
The biomass of four components (stem wood, stem bark, branches and foliage) for an individual tree can be calculated using the Individual Tree Biomass Calculator . 
 
The biomass of four components (stem wood, stem bark, branches and foliage) for a forest stand can be calculated using the Merchantable Forest Stand Biomass Calculator or the Non-Merchantable Forest Stand Biomass Calculator . 
 
The stand biomass calculators use a suite of biomass models to estimate biomass. The biomass models and their parameters were updated from the originals, which are described in the original report, Model-based volume-to-biomass conversion for forested and vegetated land in Canada which was published by the Canadian Forest Service in 2007.
