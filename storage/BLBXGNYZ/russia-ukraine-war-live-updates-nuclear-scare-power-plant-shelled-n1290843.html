A day earlier, the Ukrainian government put the death toll among children at 28.\n\nHe spoke ahead of the latest talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, planned for this weekend.\n\n“The question of humanitarian corridors is question No. 1,” Danilov said on Ukrainian television. “Children, women, elderly people — what are they doing here?”\n\nRussian troops have encircled and blockaded several large cities in the south of the country, including Mariupol, trying to cut Ukraine off from the Black and Azov seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have asked for help from the Red Cross in organizing corridors, describing the situation in the blockaded cities as “close to a catastrophe.”","description":"The head of Ukraine’s security council called on Russia to create humanitarian

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lashed out at NATO on Friday, saying in a speech that the 30-nation alliance “gave a green light” for the continued shelling of the country after the group rejected calls for a no-fly zone.\n\n“All the people who will die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, your disunity,” Zelenskyy said, according to an NBC News translation. “All that the NATO alliance was able to do to this day is arrange for the 50 tons of fuel for Ukraine.” \n\nPerhaps the country could use that fuel to burn the “Budapest Memorandum,” he said, referring to the 1994 agreement between the United States, Russia and Britain “to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.”\n\nThe Ukrainian leader has called on the U.S.-led alliance, which was founded after World War II to counter the Soviet Union, to impose a no-fly zone over the country.\n\nEarlier Friday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called the Russian invasion of Ukraine “horrific,” but said that the alliance’s core task was to keep its 30 nations “safe.”\n\n“We have made it clear that we are not going to move into Ukraine, neither on the ground or in Ukrainian airspace,” he said, adding that the only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO fighter planes into the country and shoot down Russian jets that don’t abide by it.\n\n“If we did that, we could end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war,” he said.","description":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lashed out at NATO Friday, saying in a

and Republican lawmakers are eager to send billions of dollars in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine as the government there desperately tries to repel a Russian invasion and secure the safety of more than 1 million refugees fleeing the war-torn nation.\n\nBut with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army steadily advancing, members of Congress and U.S. national security officials are now discussing the challenges of assisting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government if the capital Kyiv falls and Moscow installs a puppet regime.\n\nIt’s a grim scenario that Biden administration officials are hesitant to acknowledge publicly — especially with Zelenskyy and his troops holding off the Russians longer than many expected — but it’s one that is increasingly being debated in Washington.\n\n“One of the challenges that we’re going to face is where is going to be the seat of Ukrainian government, and is that going to have to relocate to Lviv or someplace west of the Dnieper River? Or is that going to have to relocate to some place outside of Ukraine?” Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars who serves on the Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said in a phone interview Friday.\n\nRead the full story here.","description":"U.S. debates how to aid possible Zelenskyy government in exile"},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"NBC News","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/site-images/nbcnews-logo-white.png","width":166,"height":24}},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843#ncrd1290942"},"headline":"UN: At least 1,006 civilian casualties, 331 dead ","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843#ncrd1290942","datePublished":"2022-03-05T00:20:00.000Z","dateModified":"2022-03-05T00:20:00.000Z","author":[{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Phil Helsel","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_03/3184101/phil-helsel-circle-byline-template.jpg","jobTitle":"Reporter and news editor","description":"Phil Helsel is a reporter for NBC News.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/author/phil-helsel-ncpn115631","sameAs":["https://twitter.com/PhilHelsel"]}],"image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_09/3538762/220304-irpin-ukraine-mb-1138.JPG","articleBody":"The deaths of at least 331 civilians, including 19 children, have been recorded in Ukraine since Russia attacked the country, the United Nations human rights office said Friday — but it noted the \"real toll is much higher.\"\n\nThere have been 1,006 civilian casualties in Ukraine since Russia invaded Feb. 24, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement.\n\nThat count is just the reports that have been corroborated by the agency.

military forces have occupied Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine after a night of heavy shelling, the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation has confirmed.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant remained intact, and though there was damage to the reactor compartment of one unit, it did not affect the unit's safety, the state inspectorate said on Facebook, according to an NBC News translation. \n\nA fire broke out at a training facility at the plant after Russian shelling earlier Friday, sparking concerns that an explosion at the facility could be worse than the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. It was later extinguished. \n\nThe plant’s personnel are monitoring the condition of the units, and no changes in radiation status have been recorded, the state office said. "}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843"},"coverageEndTime":"2022-03-05T06:57:00.000Z"}</script><title>Russian forces in control at nuclear plant</title><meta name="description" content="Fears of a nuclear catastrophe worse than the Chernobyl disaster were raised early Friday when Russian shelling hit Ukraine's and Europe's largest nuclear power plant."><link rel="canonical" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843"><meta property="og:url" content="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843"><meta property="og:title" content="Russian forces control nuclear plant after fire, humanitarian crisis grows"><meta property="og:description" content="Fears of a nuclear catastrophe worse than the Chernobyl disaster were raised Friday when Russian shelling hit Europe's largest nuclear power plant."><meta property="og:image" content="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_09/3538710/220304-zaporizhzhia-plant-mb-0730.jpg"><meta property="og:image:secure_url" content="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_09/3538710/220304-zaporizhzhia-plant-mb-0730.jpg"><meta property="og:image:type" content="image/jpeg"><meta property="og:image:width" content="1200"><meta property="og:image:height" content="630"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta name="twitter:image:src" content="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_09/3538710/220304-zaporizhzhia-plant-mb-0730.jpg"><meta name="twitter:image" content="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_09/3538710/220304-zaporizhzhia-plant-mb-0730.jpg"><meta name="twitter:title" content="Russian forces control nuclear plant after fire, humanitarian crisis grows"><meta name="twitter:description" content="Fears of a nuclear catastrophe worse than the Chernobyl disaster were raised Friday when Russian shelling hit Europe's largest nuclear power plant."><meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image"><meta name="thumbnail" content="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x768_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_09/3538710/220304-zaporizhzhia-plant-mb-0730.jpg"><link rel="amphtml" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/live-blog/ncna1290843"><link rel="preload" href="220304-irpin-ukraine-mb-1138.JPG" as="image" media="(max-width: 758px)"><link rel="preload" href="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1000w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_09/3538762/220304-irpin-ukraine-mb-1138.JPG" as="image" media="(min-width: 758.1px) and (max-width: 1000px)"><link rel="preload" href="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1240w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_09/3538762/220304-irpin-ukraine-mb-1138.JPG" as="image" media="(min-width: 1000.1px)"><link rel="preconnect" href="https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/"><link rel="preconnect" href="https://link.theplatform.com/"><link rel="preconnect" href="https://mssl.fwmrm.net/"><link rel="preconnect" href="https://search.spotxchange.com/"><link rel="preconnect" href="https://tracker.nbcuas.com/"><link rel="preconnect" href="https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/"><link rel="preconnect" href="https://29773.v.fwmrm.net/"><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","@id":"https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/inside-ukraine-school-where-80-orphans-have-found-refuge-134635077701","name":"Inside Ukraine school where 80 orphans have found refuge","description":"An unprecedented 500,000 children have fled Ukraine in just the last week, according to UNICEF, but some have not been able to leave.

class="">Ukrainian
 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lashed out at NATO on Friday, saying in a
 speech that the 30-nation alliance “gave a green light” for the 
continued shelling of the country after the group rejected calls for a 
no-fly zone.</p><p class="">“All the people who will die from this day 
forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, your 
disunity,” Zelenskyy said, according to an NBC News translation. “All 
that the NATO alliance was able to do to this day is arrange for the 50 
tons of fuel for Ukraine.”&nbsp;</p><p class="">Perhaps the country could use that fuel to burn the “Budapest Memorandum,” he said, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/12/05/why-care-about-ukraine-and-the-budapest-memorandum/" target="_blank">referring to the 1994 agreement </a>between the United States, Russia and Britain “to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.”</p><p class="">The
 Ukrainian leader has called on the U.S.-led alliance, which was founded
 after World War II to counter the Soviet Union, to impose a no-fly zone
 over the country.</p><p class="">Earlier Friday, NATO Secretary General
 Jens Stoltenberg called the Russian invasion of Ukraine “horrific,” but
 said that the alliance’s core task was to keep its 30 nations “safe.”</p><p class="">“We
 have made it clear that we are not going to move into Ukraine, neither 
on the ground or in Ukrainian airspace,” he said, adding that the only 
way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO fighter planes into the 
country and shoot down Russian jets that don’t abide by it.</p><p class="">“If we did that, we could end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war,” he said.</p><div class="df justify-start mt6 lh-none share-list dn-print"><input class="dn" id="social-menu-toggle--29769" tabindex="-1" checked="checked" type="checkbox"><ul class="share-list__social-list js-social-share"><li class="share-list__social-list-text founders-mono">Share this -</li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-facebook share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon social-share-list__icon--twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Zelenskyy%20accuses%20NATO%20of%20giving%20%27green%20light%27%20to%20continued%20shelling%20of%20Ukraine&amp;via=NBCNews&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290945&amp;original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-twitter share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon"><a href="mailto:?subject=Zelenskyy%20accuses%20NATO%20of%20giving%20'green%20light'%20to%20continued%20shelling%20of%20Ukraine&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290945"><span class="icon icon-email share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="live-blog-card article-body__content w-100 mh0 mb8 fn overflow-x-hidden" id="ncrd1290944"><div class="live-blog-card__stripes"></div><h2 class="styles_cardTitle__OnwNs">U.S. debates how to aid possible Zelenskyy government in exile</h2><div class="card-byline mb5 df"><div class="byline-thumbnail byline-thumbnail--has-image mt1 mr2"><picture><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x120,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_08/3536979/screen_shot_2022-02-24_at_12-15-16_am.png 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_08/3536979/screen_shot_2022-02-24_at_12-15-16_am.png 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="screen_shot_2022-02-24_at_12-15-16_am.jpg" alt="" width="48" height="48"></picture></div><div class="df flex-column"><p class="f4 founders-cond mv0 gray-80"><span class="byline-name">Scott Wong</span></p><div class="timestamps founders-mono f2">6d ago / 12:20 AM UTC</div></div></div><p class="">Democratic and Republican lawmakers are eager to send billions of dollars in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843" target="_blank">military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine</a>&nbsp;as the government there desperately tries to repel a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/russia-ukraine-news" target="_blank">Russian invasion</a>&nbsp;and secure the safety of more than 1 million refugees fleeing the war-torn nation.</p><p class="">But
 with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army steadily advancing, 
members of Congress and U.S. national security officials are now 
discussing the challenges of assisting Ukrainian President Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy’s government if the capital Kyiv falls and Moscow installs a 
puppet regime.</p><p class="">It’s a grim scenario that Biden 
administration officials are hesitant to acknowledge publicly — 
especially with Zelenskyy and his troops holding off the Russians longer
 than many expected — but it’s one that is increasingly being debated in
 Washington.</p><p class="">“One of the challenges that we’re going to 
face is where is going to be the seat of Ukrainian government, and is 
that going to have to relocate to Lviv or someplace west of the Dnieper 
River? Or is that going to have to relocate to some place outside of 
Ukraine?” Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a veteran of the Iraq and 
Afghanistan wars who serves on the Intelligence and Armed Services 
committees, said in a phone interview Friday.</p><p class=""><em>Read the full story <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/us-debates-aid-possible-zelenskyy-government-exile-rcna18817" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p><div class="df justify-start mt6 lh-none share-list dn-print"><input class="dn" id="social-menu-toggle--29770" tabindex="-1" checked="checked" type="checkbox"><ul class="share-list__social-list js-social-share"><li class="share-list__social-list-text founders-mono">Share this -</li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-facebook share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon social-share-list__icon--twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=U.S.%20debates%20how%20to%20aid%20possible%20Zelenskyy%20government%20in%20exile&amp;via=NBCNews&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290944&amp;original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-twitter share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon"><a href="mailto:?subject=U.S.%20debates%20how%20to%20aid%20possible%20Zelenskyy%20government%20in%20exile&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290944"><span class="icon icon-email share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="ad mb8 ad--text-alignment ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print"><div data-mps="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div><div class="live-blog-card article-body__content w-100 mh0 mb8 fn overflow-x-hidden" id="ncrd1290942"><div class="live-blog-card__stripes"></div><h2 class="styles_cardTitle__OnwNs">UN: At least 1,006 civilian casualties, 331 dead</h2><div class="card-byline mb5 df"><div class="byline-thumbnail byline-thumbnail--has-image mt1 mr2"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/phil-helsel-ncpn115631"><picture><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x120,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_03/3184101/phil-helsel-circle-byline-template.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_03/3184101/phil-helsel-circle-byline-template.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="phil-helsel-circle-byline-template.jpg" alt="" width="48" height="48"></picture></a></div><div class="df flex-column"><p class="f4 founders-cond mv0 gray-80"><span class="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/phil-helsel-ncpn115631">Phil Helsel</a></span></p><div class="timestamps founders-mono f2">6d ago / 12:20 AM UTC</div></div></div><p class="">The

 chief correspondent for Sky News said a Russian “reconnaissance squad” 
opened fire on his news crew early this week, wounding him and striking 
his camera operator’s body armor while they were reporting northwest of 
Kyiv.</p><p class=""><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/sky-news-teams-harrowing-account-of-their-violent-ambush-in-ukraine-this-week-12557585" target="_blank">In a dispatch published</a>&nbsp;Friday
 on the U.K. outlet’s site, chief correspondent Stuart Ramsey said the 
crew came under “full attack” while trying to reach the town of Bucha, 
where they were traveling to see a Russian convoy that had reportedly 
been destroyed the day before.</p><p class="">NBC News has not 
independently confirmed Ramsey’s account. A graphic video included in 
the story captures what appears to be shells striking their vehicle and 
the crew shouting that they’re journalists.</p><p class="">The attack 
occurred while they driving down a deserted stretch of road, Ramsey 
said. There was a small explosion and the car's tire burst, he said, 
adding:&nbsp;“And then our world turned upside down."</p><p class="">“Bullets
 cascaded through the whole of the car, tracers, bullet flashes, 
windscreen glass, plastic seats, the steering wheel, and dashboard had 
disintegrated,” he wrote.</p><p class="">Ramsey said he was shot in the 
lower back. Camera operator Richie Mockler was hit twice in his vest. 
The three other members of their crew escaped uninjured.</p><p class="">The team is now back in the U.K., the outlet reported.</p><div class="df justify-start mt6 lh-none share-list dn-print"><input class="dn" id="social-menu-toggle--29774" tabindex="-1" checked="checked" type="checkbox"><ul class="share-list__social-list js-social-share"><li class="share-list__social-list-text founders-mono">Share this -</li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-facebook share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon social-share-list__icon--twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Sky%20News%20correspondent%20says%20he%20was%20injured%20after%20crew%20attacked%20by%20Russian%20%27reconnaissance%20squad%27&amp;via=NBCNews&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290936&amp;original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-twitter share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon"><a href="mailto:?subject=Sky%20News%20correspondent%20says%20he%20was%20injured%20after%20crew%20attacked%20by%20Russian%20'reconnaissance%20squad'&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290936"><span class="icon icon-email share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="ad mb8 ad--text-alignment ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print"><div data-mps="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div><div class="live-blog-card article-body__content w-100 mh0 mb8 fn overflow-x-hidden" id="ncrd1290935"><div class="live-blog-card__stripes"></div><h2 class="styles_cardTitle__OnwNs">CNN to stop broadcasting in Russia amid expanding media restrictions</h2><div class="card-byline mb5 df"><div class="byline-thumbnail byline-thumbnail--has-image mt1 mr2"><picture><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x120,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_03/3184066/dennis-romero-circle-byline-template.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_03/3184066/dennis-romero-circle-byline-template.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="dennis-romero-circle-byline-template.jpg" alt="" width="48" height="48"></picture></div><div class="df flex-column"><p class="f4 founders-cond mv0 gray-80"><span class="byline-name">Dennis Romero</span></p><div class="timestamps founders-mono f2">6d ago / 10:44 PM UTC</div></div></div><p class="">A

 — The head of the World Food Program says the U.N. organization is

Ukraine.</p><p class="">David Beasley, who spoke from Warsaw, Poland, 
said that the organization was putting together teams around Ukraine’s

 needing food support immediately.” He said the program was leasing 
warehouses, trying to figure out how much food it can potentially buy in
 Ukraine and how much can be brought from outside.</p><p class="">He 
praised the response of Poles, who have been meeting fleeing Ukrainians 
at the border, ”making certain they’re getting hot meals, taking them to
 wherever they need to go,” calling it “really, really quite

 Vice President Mike Pence will tell Republican donors Friday that there
 "is no room in this party for apologists for Putin," according to 
speech excerpts shared with NBC News.</p><p class="">The remarks from 
Pence, who is scheduled to address a Republican National Committee 
retreat in New Orleans, will signal another split with former President 
Donald Trump. In the lead-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, 
Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-praises-putins-genius-gop-fissures-grow-ukraine-crisis-rcna17259" target="_blank">called Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy</a> "genius" and "savvy."</p><p class="">“To
 those who argue that NATO expansion is somehow responsible for the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine, ask yourself, where would our friends in 
Eastern Europe be today if they were not in NATO?" Pence is expected to 
say. "Where would Russian tanks be today if NATO had not expanded the 
borders of freedom?&nbsp;There is no room in this party for apologists 
for Putin. There is only room for champions of freedom."</p><p class="">Pence,
 who could find himself in a GOP presidential primary with Trump in 
2024, has been at odds with Trump since they lost the 2020 election, 
which Trump has falsely claimed was stolen. Pence has rejected Trump's 
claim that the vice president had the power to overturn the election 
results in their favor.</p><p class="">“I heard this week that President Trump said I had the right to overturn the election," <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/president-trump-wrong-mike-pence-rejects-claim-overturned-election-rcna14952" target="_blank">Pence said last month during a speech in Orlando, Florida</a>.

Ukraine.</p><p class="">Speaking at a NATO meeting in Brussels, he said Russia's invasion was "a&nbsp;blatant violation of international law."</p><p class="">"We
 have seen the use of cluster bombs, we have seen reports of use of 
other types of weapons which will be in violation of international law,"
 he said.</p><p class="">"And of course NATO and NATO allies and 
partners are collecting information and monitoring very closely what is 
going on in Ukraine," he added.&nbsp;</p><p class="">His comments come 
after Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said Russia 
had used a vacuum bomb Monday in its invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p><p class="">"They
 used the vacuum bomb today, which is actually prohibited by the Geneva 
convention," Markarova had said at the time after briefing U.S. Congress
 members.&nbsp;</p><p class="">A vacuum bomb uses oxygen from the 
surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion, which can 
produce a blast wave of a significantly longer duration than that of a 
conventional explosive.</p><div class="df justify-start mt6 lh-none share-list dn-print"><input class="dn" id="social-menu-toggle--29801" tabindex="-1" checked="checked" type="checkbox"><ul

 press secretary Adm. John Kirby said Friday that the U.S. agrees with 
assessments that there was "no radioactive leakage" from Ukraine's 
Zaporizhzhia power plant and that the damage at the plant has been 
"fairly limited."&nbsp;</p><p class="">Kirby, who made the comment in an
 interview on MSNBC's "Morning Joe," said the Pentagon is working 
closely with the Department of Energy to assess the damage. He said the 
attack on the plant by Russians "speaks to the recklessness and the 
dangerous atmosphere and fear inside Ukraine caused by this unprovoked 
war of aggression, this unprovoked invasion by Russia."</p><p class="">The
 spokesman said Russians have not been discriminate in their military 
campaign and the situation regarding the power plant is "an example of 
just how dangerous this can get not just for the people of Ukraine, but 
for the European continent.”</p><div class="df justify-start mt6 lh-none share-list dn-print"><input class="dn" id="social-menu-toggle--29806" tabindex="-1" checked="checked" type="checkbox"><ul class="share-list__social-list js-social-share"><li class="share-list__social-list-text founders-mono">Share this -</li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-facebook share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon social-share-list__icon--twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Pentagon%20spokesman%20Adm.%20John%20Kirby%20says%20%27no%20radioactive%20leakage%27%20at%20Ukraine%20nuclear%20plant&amp;via=NBCNews&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290868&amp;original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-twitter share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon"><a href="mailto:?subject=Pentagon%20spokesman%20Adm.%20John%20Kirby%20says%20'no%20radioactive%20leakage'%20at%20Ukraine%20nuclear%20plant&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-updates-nuclear-scare-power-plant-shelled-n1290843%3FfeatureFlag%3Dfalse%23ncrd1290868"><span class="icon icon-email share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="ad mb8 ad--text-alignment ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print"><div data-mps="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div><div class="live-blog-card article-body__content w-100 mh0 mb8 fn overflow-x-hidden" id="ncrd1290867"><div class="live-blog-card__stripes"></div><h2 class="styles_cardTitle__OnwNs">Nuclear power plant attack could have killed millions, Ukrainian lawmaker says</h2><div class="card-byline mb5 df"><div class="byline-thumbnail byline-thumbnail--has-image mt1 mr2"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/patrick-smith-ncpn989401"><picture><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x120,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_03/3183971/patrick-smith-circle-byline-template.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_03/3183971/patrick-smith-circle-byline-template.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="patrick-smith-circle-byline-template.jpg" alt="" width="48" height="48"></picture></a></div><div class="df flex-column"><p class="f4 founders-cond mv0 gray-80"><span class="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/patrick-smith-ncpn989401">Patrick Smith</a></span></p><div class="timestamps founders-mono f2">6d ago / 12:33 PM UTC</div></div></div><p class="">The

 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video Friday morning that the 
Russian attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant could have led to
 a tragedy for Ukraine and for Europe and appealed to the Russian forces
 to remember history.</p><p class="">Speaking in Russian, he said: 
“Together in 1986 we struggled with the consequences of the Chernobyl 
disaster. You must remember the burning graphite scattered by the 
explosion, the victims. You must remember the glow above the destroyed 
power unit. You must remember the evacuation from Pripyat and the 30km 
(18.5 miles) zone. How can you forget it?,” he said.</p><p class="">“And
 if you have not forgotten, then you cannot be silent, you must tell 
your authorities, go out to the streets and say that you want to live. 
You want to live on earth without radioactive contamination. Radiation 
does not know where Russia is, radiation does not know where the borders
 of your country are,” the leader added.</p><div class="df justify-start mt6 lh-none share-list dn-print"><input class="dn" id="social-menu-toggle--29814" tabindex="-1" checked="checked"

 military forces have occupied Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in

was damage to the reactor compartment of one unit, it did not affect the
 unit's safety, the&nbsp;state inspectorate said on Facebook, according 
to an NBC News translation.&nbsp;</p><p class="">A fire broke out at a 
training facility at the plant after Russian shelling earlier Friday, 
sparking concerns that an explosion at the facility could be worse than 
the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. It was later extinguished.&nbsp;</p><p class="">The
 plant’s personnel are monitoring the condition of the units, and no 
changes in radiation status have been recorded, the state office 
said.&nbsp;</p><div class="df justify-start mt6 lh-none share-list dn-print"><input class="dn" id="social-menu-toggle--29820" tabindex="-1" checked="checked" type="checkbox"><ul

United States, Russia and Britain “to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.”","The Ukrainian leader has called on the U.S.-led alliance, which was founded after World War II to counter the Soviet Union, to impose a no-fly zone over the country.","Earlier Friday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called the Russian invasion of Ukraine “horrific,” but said that the alliance’s core task was to keep its 30 nations “safe.”","“We have made it clear that we are not going to move into Ukraine, neither on the ground or in Ukrainian airspace,” he said, adding that the only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO fighter planes into the country and shoot down Russian jets that don’t abide by it.","“If we did that, we could end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war,” he said."]},"cardData":{"graphics":[]},"date":{"createdAt":"2022-03-05T00:59:10.000Z","publishedAt":"2022-03-05T00:59:10.000Z","modifiedAt":"2022-03-05T00:59:10.000Z"},"description":{"primary":"Ukrainian
