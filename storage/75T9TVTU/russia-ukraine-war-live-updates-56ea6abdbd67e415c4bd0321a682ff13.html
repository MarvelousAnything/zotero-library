former beauty queen several months ago.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Didusenko

millions of Ukrainian children and their mothers are trembling at every

 — Additional air defense capabilities are the number one priority for 
Ukraine’s military right now, the country’s U.S. defense attache, Maj. 
Gen. Borys Kremenetskyi, said Tuesday after returning from a meeting at 
the Pentagon. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">“It
 can be ground based air defense systems. It can be fighter jets, 
whatever possible,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">He
 said there are countries around the world that have Soviet-produced air
 defense systems that the Ukrainians already know how to operate. “The 
U.S. government can also motivate those countries to provide us this 
equipment,” he said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">They
 also need additional anti-tank, anti-armor weapons and coastal defense 
capabilities to defend against Russian ships at the south.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">He
 said Ukraine is grateful for the support it has gotten from the U.S. 
and its allies, which has allowed Ukraine to slow the Russian advance. 
“As combat is ongoing, we need more right now,” Kremenetskyi said. “So 
we try to work with our partners to have it as soon as possible.” </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">UNITED

 and says “the critical situation” in Mariupol and other cities demands 
immediate action by world leaders and humanitarian and medical 
organizations.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">She
 told a U.N. Security Council meeting Tuesday afternoon on women in

leave and the humanitarian aid is not let in.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">“If
 they try to leave, Russians open fire and kill them,” Mudrenko said, 
her voice shaking with emotion. “They are running out of food and water,

 Mudrenko said a 6-year-old girl died Monday in the besieged city of 
Mariupol on the Azov Sea, “alone in the last moments of her life as her 
mother was killed by Russian shelling.” </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">On
 Tuesday in the Mykolaiv region, she said “Russian occupiers fired at a 
van with a group of female teachers of the local orphanage (and) three 
of them were killed.” She said there are also “cases of child sexual 
violence committed by occupiers.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Mudrenko

 said when he went to address the British Parliament, “the scariest

in an hour it became 52 children. I will never forgive this. And I know 
that you will never forgive the occupiers.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Zelenskyy

 killed in the town of Chuhuiv just east of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine 
late Tuesday. And in the city of Malyn in the Zhytomyr region west of 
the capital Kyiv at least five people, including two children, were 
killed in a Russian air strike.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The

 said that the shelling made it impossible to evacuate the bodies of

 Central Bank has sharply tightened currency restrictions amid crippling
 Western sanctions over the Russian war in Ukraine.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The
 bank ordered the country’s commercial banks to cap the amount clients 
can withdraw from their hard currency deposits at $10,000. Any 
withdrawals above that amount would be converted to rubles at the 
current exchange rates.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">It
 also told commercial banks to stop selling hard currency to clients, a 
measure that will likely foment a black market for foreign currency. The
 draconian restrictions are unprecedented since the Soviet times when 
the authorities maintained strict hard currency controls. The Central 
Bank noted that the currency controls were tightened because of the 
Western sanctions that froze a large share of the Central Bank’s hard 
currency reserves. The crippling blow to the country’s financial system 
also prevented Russia from getting foreign cash.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">____</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">LVIV,

 Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that 5,000 people, 
including 1,700 foreign students, were evacuated from Sumy.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Vereshchuk
 reaffirmed that Ukraine will not accept Moscow’s offer to establish 
safe corridors for civilians to head toward Russia, saying it will only 
agree to safe exits leading westward.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Vereshchuk
 said that the evacuation from the southern port of Mariupol failed 
Tuesday because the Russian troops fired on a Ukrainian convoy carrying 
humanitarian cargo to Mariupol that was to carry civilians from the city
 on its way back. She said the city was in a “catastrophic situation” 
cut from water, power and communications, adding that a child in 
Mariupol has died of dehydration.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The Russian military has denied firing on convoys and charged that the Ukrainian side was blocking the evacuation effort.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">____</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">KYIV,

 Zelenska said in an open letter to global media released Tuesday that 
the Russian invasion amounted to “the mass murder of Ukrainian 
civilians.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">She 
said that “the most terrifying and devastating of this invasion are the 
child casualties,” mentioning eight-year-old Alice who died on the 
streets of Okhtyrka while her grandfather tried to protect her. She also
 cited 14-year-old Arseniy was hit in the head by wreckage, and could 
not be saved because an ambulance could not get to him on time because 
of intense fires.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Zelenska
 added that “this war is being waged against the civilian population, 
and not just through shelling,” citing the lack of basic medicines in 
the besieged Ukrainian cities.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">She
 seconded President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s call on Western allies to help
 counter the Russian air superiority, saying “close the sky, and we will

 Russian military offered again on Tuesday to provide humanitarian 
corridors for civilians to leave five Ukrainian cities after several 
previous attempts to establish safe exits have failed.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Ukrainian
 officials said that Russian shelling again made it impossible for 
civilians to use the corridors on Tuesday despite a deal reached a day 
earlier. The Russian military has countered the claim, alleging that 
Ukraine only has allowed civilians to use one corridor from the city of 
Sumy and blocked other routes from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and 
Mariupol.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Russian
 Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev said Tuesday that the Russian military has

 Poland — Poland said it would give all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to 
the U.S., apparently agreeing to an arrangement that would allow them to
 be used by Ukraine’s military. Ukraine has pleaded for more warplanes. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The
 decision came Tuesday as Washington was looking at a proposal under 
which Poland would supply Ukraine with Soviet-era fighters and in turn 
receive American F-16s to make up for their loss. Ukrainian pilots are 
trained to fly Soviet-era fighter jets.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The
 Polish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Poland is ready to

courage, we share your pain, we stand with you.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">It
 was International Women’s Day on Tuesday and at a U.N. Security Council
 meeting focusing on empowering women economically in conflict areas 
many speakers decried Russia’s war on neighboring Ukraine, and its 
impact on women.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">But
 Russia’s deputy ambassador Gennady Kuzmin lashed out at sanctions on 
his country and accused “a cold Western world” of looking on with

the Russian-backed separatist areas in eastern Ukraine.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Sima
 Bahous, the head of UN Women, told the council that in Ukraine 
“humanitarian needs are multiplying and spreading by the hour,” and the 
majority of those fleeing the conflict are women and children. She 
warned of the risk of “a backsliding of women’s rights and women’s 
access to employment and livelihoods” in the war-torn country.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Bahous
 told a separate U.N. Women’s Day event that “the horrifying situation”

their highest price from women and girls.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">____</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">JERUSALEM
 — Israel said Tuesday it will provide temporary refuge to some 25,000 
Ukrainians outside of its Law of Return, under which all Jews are 
eligible for citizenship.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Interior
 Minister Ayelet Shaked said in a statement that 20,000 Ukrainians who 
were in Israel without legal status before the outbreak of fighting will
 be shielded from repatriation “until the danger subsides.” Another 
5,000 Ukrainians will initially be granted three-month visas and will be
 allowed to work if the fighting continues beyond then. Ukrainians can 
apply for the program online through the Israeli Foreign Ministry’s 
website.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Israel 
expects to absorb around 100,000 Ukrainians through its Law of Return, 
under which Jews from anywhere in the world can come to Israel and get 
citizenship, Shaked said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Established
 in the wake of the Holocaust, Israel views itself as a refuge for Jews 
fleeing war and persecution worldwide. But it has been reluctant to 
absorb non-Jewish immigrants, including Africans fleeing conflict and 
poverty.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">It has 
also refused to allow the return of hundreds of thousands of 
Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes in what is now 
Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. Israel says 
allowing the return of Palestinian refugees and their descendants — who 
now number more than 5 million — would spell the end of Israel as a

back to Helsinki each time as the GPS signal was disrupted.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">Finland
 shares a 1,340-kilometer (833-mile) land border with Russia. The

A firefighter grabbed the boy's hand and his eyes blinked but he was otherwise still. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The city's streets were eerily empty, with most people sheltering indoors. But one man, Aleksander Ivanov, was pulling a trolley with his possessions in search of place to stay because shelling destroyed his home. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At the Brovary Central District Hospital on the eastern outskirts of Kyiv, a 14-year-old girl named Katya lay in bed with the covers pulled up to her neck.

He claimed without providing evidence that the Mariupol hospital had been seized by far-right radical fighters who were using it as a base — despite the fact that photos and videos of the aftermath showed pregnant women and children at the site.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More than 2.3 million people have fled the war in Ukraine and an estimated 1.9 million are displaced within the country, a U.N. official said Thursday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ukrainian forces slowed or stopped a Russian advance that was trying to encircle Kyiv from the north to the west, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said Thursday night. It said Ukrainian forces also drove Russians out of Baklanova Muraviika, a village near Chernihiv that sits on a road to the capital.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Earlier Thursday, that office said Russian forces had captured several Kyiv suburbs, were trying to take Chernihiv and were advancing on the southern cities of Mykolaiv, Kryviy Rih, Voznesensk and Novovorontsovka. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said about 2 million people — half the residents of the Ukrainian capital’s metropolitan area — have left the city, which has become a virtual fortress.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Every street, every house … is being fortified,” he said in televised remarks. “Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Russia has deployed more than 150,000 troops and retains large and possibly decisive advantages in firepower, despite facing fierce Ukrainian resistance and global financial pressure aimed at crippling its economy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Russian forces on Thursday shelled a nuclear research institute in Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, setting buildings on fire, said Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Interior Ministry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Firefighters managed to extinguish the blazes, but Gerashchenko said a shell hit a building that houses equipment that could release radiation if it were damaged. According to the president’s office, there has been no change in the background radiation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Russia’s deputy energy minister, Yevgeny Grabchak, said Thursday that \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-science-business-nuclear-power-physics-4ef041a54e2d9293ec72c58d20e44225\">power was restored\u003c/a> to the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Rafael Grossi, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters Thursday in Vienna that the nuclear watchdog had ”scheduled physical inspections” of Ukraine's nuclear facilities, though he when or how those inspections would take place.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ABOUT DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Several rounds of talks between Ukraine and Russia haven't stopped the fighting, and a meeting Thursday in Turkey between Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, failed to find common ground.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In their highest-level talks since the war began, the two sides discussed a 24-hour cease-fire but didn't make progress toward one, Kuleba said. He said Russia was still seeking “surrender from Ukraine.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is not what they are going to get,” he said, adding that he was willing to continue the dialogue.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lavrov said Russia was ready for more negotiations but showed no sign of softening Moscow’s demands. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Russia has alleged that Western-looking, U.S.-backed Ukraine poses a threat to Russian security. Western officials suspect Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to install a Moscow-friendly government in Kyiv as part of an effort to draw the former Soviet state back into its orbit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>French President Emmanuel Macron joined the ranks of Western leaders who have condemned the Russian airstrike on the Mariupol hospital, calling it “a shameful and amoral act of war.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>During a visit to Poland, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-harris-embraces-calls-for-war-crimes-probe-792555553cca39ef9e1b4f1e7f8cebe6\">embraced calls for an international investigation\u003c/a>, though she stopped short of directly accusing Russia of having committed war crimes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT DEFENSIVE ASSISTANCE IS UKRAINE GETTING?\u003c/p>\u003cp>European nations have sent weapons to Ukraine’s military. Furthermore, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday night that \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-us-aid-package-41cc2e66c7714b37eca9d2bb8add53aa\">would rush $13.6 billion in American aid\u003c/a> to Ukraine and its European allies, nearly half of that for sending troops and weapons to Eastern Europe and equipping allied forces there. The bill is expected to pass through the Senate as well in the coming days.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Ukrainian government says about 20,000 foreigners have joined the so-called the International Legion for the Territorial Defense of Ukraine, where they are given weapons to fight when they arrive. Among them are about 100 of the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-d0243a1708a3115e5ad0ac40aed99b9f\">several thousand Americans\u003c/a> who asked to join the fight, a Ukrainian official said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT’S THE VIEW FROM INSIDE RUSSIA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>During a televised meeting with Kremlin officials on Thursday, Putin addressed the Western sanctions that have caused the ruble to crash and led many major companies to leave Russia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The pressure of sanctions has always been there. Yes, of course, now it is complex and creates certain challenges, problems, difficulties for us. But just as we overcame these difficulties in the previous years, we will overcome them now. We must go through this period. The economy will certainly adapt to the new situation.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>The list of companies that have stopped operating in Russia grew Thursday, with German fashion brand Hugo Boss temporarily closing its stores and U.S.-based hotel chains Hilton and Marriott closing their Moscow offices, though their Russian hotels are owned and operated by franchisees and will stay open. The Walt Disney Co. said that in addition to pausing film releases in Russia, as previously announced, it was also “taking steps to pause all other businesses” there. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Goldman Sachs said it would close its operations in Russia entirely, making it the first major Wall Street bank to do so since Russia invaded Ukraine. And JPMorgan Chase said it was “unwinding” its Russian banking business.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-technology-business-europe-media-f1da10285a1631542b332597c5d35c29\"> Twitter launched a privacy-protected version\u003c/a> of its site to bypass surveillance and censorship after Russia restricted access to its service in the country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow the AP’s coverage of the war between Russia and Ukraine: \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine \u003c/a>\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"Kyiv","name":"Kyiv","canonicalName":"kyiv","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:29178de14c7e444cf907d192614f1ddb","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:29178de14c7e444cf907d192614f1ddb","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:29178de14c7e444cf907d192614f1ddb","shortId":"29178de14c7e444cf907d192614f1ddb","bylines":"By RAFAL NIEDZIELSKI","canonicalUrl":"russia-ukraine-kyiv-poland-crime-war-crimes","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>PRZEMYSL, Poland (AP) — As more than 2 million refugees from Ukraine begin to scatter throughout Europe and beyond, some are carrying valuable witness evidence to build a case for potential war crimes.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"'They were shooting civilians': Ukraine refugees saw abuses","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"9e0ee0280d834b1f9c85d7123dd500a2","leadVideoId":null,"localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/29178de14c7e444cf907d192614f1ddb","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"9e0ee0280d834b1f9c85d7123dd500a2","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>A Polish soldier holds a baby as refugees fleeing war in neighboring Ukraine arrive at the Medyka crossing border, Poland, Thursday, March 10, 2022.

Compressed layout (automatic embed)\u003c/div>\u003cp>Chelsea has won five Premier League titles under Abramovich along with two Champions League titles, the latest last year. Victory in the Club World Cup last month completed the set of major honors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The success has been funded by around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) of loans to the club that Abramovich said he didn't want repaid when putting the club up for sale last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHY SANCTION ABRAMOVICH?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich has used legal means to try to publicly distance himself from benefiting from an association with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The British government thinks otherwise, saying Abramovich has obtained “a financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the government of Russia,\" including tax breaks, the sale of shares at favorable rates, and contracts in the buildup to Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich “is or has been involved in destabilizing Ukraine” via Evraz, a steel manufacturing and mining company which he effectively controls and has potentially supplied the Russia military, the government said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His fortune was made in oil and aluminium following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2005, Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom paid $13 billion for the Sibneft oil company controlled by Abramovich. It allowed Putin’s Kremlin to recapture state influence in the lucrative energy industry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON CHELSEA?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The sanctions could have immediately forced Chelsea to stop running as a business, and preventing its teams from completing their seasons. Instead, a special license has been issued to allow it to continue operating, subject to heavy restrictions.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Only fans already with tickets — mainly season ticket holders — can attend matches, shutting out away fans from games. The club's shop had to close on Thursday morning. Staff at the hotel built onto Stamford Bridge said they were under orders to no longer accept new reservations or sell food and drink.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Only 500,000 pounds ($657,000) can be spent on staging each match at Stamford Bridge, including on security and catering. A maximum of 20,000 pounds can be spent on travel to matches. Chelsea plays in France at Lille in the Champions League next week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Player recruitment is also prohibited under the terms of the government license that runs through May 31. There are players with contracts expiring at the end of the season in June and the sanctions create uncertainty over whether Cesar Azpilicueta, Toni Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen could be offered new deals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>CAN CHELSEA STILL BE SOLD?\u003c/p>\u003cp>As calls grew in the British parliament for Abramovich to be sanctioned, Chelsea was put up for sale.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated,” Abramovich said. “The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>It gave the impression of being an entity that Abramovich would be involved with. The foundation could have benefited Russian victims, too.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chelsea sought potential bidders to register their interest by next week. But now the government has oversight of the process.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“While the current license does not permit the sale of the club at this time, the government is open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a new license to allow for a sale,” the government said. “Proceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"BorisJohnson","name":"Boris Johnson","canonicalName":"boris-johnson","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-sports","name":"Sports","canonicalName":"sports","isPr":false},{"id":"Soccer","name":"Soccer","canonicalName":"soccer","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-EuropeanSports","name":"Sports -

Ukrainians can apply for the program online through the Israeli Foreign Ministry’s website.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Israel expects to absorb around 100,000 Ukrainians through its Law of Return, under which Jews from anywhere in the world can come to Israel and get citizenship, Shaked said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Established in the wake of the Holocaust, Israel views itself as a refuge for Jews fleeing war and persecution worldwide.
