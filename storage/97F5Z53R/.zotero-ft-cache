Abstract
McPherson, E. Gregory; van Doorn, Natalie S.; Peper, Paula J. 2016. Urban Tree Database and Allometric Equations. Gen. Tech. Rep. PSW-GTR-235. Albany, CA: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station. 86 p.
Information on urban tree growth underpins models used to calculate the effects of trees on the environment and human well-being. Maximum tree size and other growth data are used by urban forest managers, landscape architects, and planners to select trees most suitable to the amount of growing space, thereby reducing costly future conflicts between trees and infrastructure. Growth data are used to examine relationships between growth and influencing factors such as site conditions and stewardship practices. Despite the importance of tree growth data to the science and practice of urban forestry, our knowledge in this area is scant. Over a period of 14 years, scientists with the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station recorded data from a consistent set of measurements on over 14,000 trees in 17 U.S. cities. Key information collected for each tree species includes bole and crown size, location, and age. From this Urban Tree Database, 365 sets of tree growth equations were developed for the 171 distinct species. Appendices contain field data collection protocols, foliar biomass data that are fundamental to calculating leaf area, tree biomass equations for carbon storage estimates, and a user guide that illustrates application of the equations to calculate carbon stored over many years for tree species that were measured in multiple cities. An online database at http://dx.doi. org/10.2737/RDS-2016-0005 includes the raw data, growth equations, coefficients, and application information for each species’ volume and dry-weight-biomass equations for urban and rural forest trees; and an expanded list of biomass density factors for common urban tree species.

Urban Tree Database and Allometric Equations
Chapter 1: Introduction
Tree size and age influence management costs and ecosystem services derived from urban trees. Urban forest researchers have developed allometric equations for trees in urban environments, but their range of application and predictive power are limited owing to small sample sizes, few species, young trees only, excellent-condition trees only, and narrow geographic region. This research overcomes many of these limitations. Based on measurements of 14,487 urban street and park trees, an Urban Tree Database (UTD) was constructed. From the UTD, 365 sets of allometric equations were developed for tree species from around the United States. Each “set” consists of eight equations for each of the approximately 20 most abundant species in each of 16 climate regions. Tree age is used to predict species diameter at breast height (d.b.h.), and d.b.h. is used to predict tree height, crown diameter, crown height, and leaf area. Diameter at breast height is also used to predict age. For applications with remote sensing, average crown diameter is used to predict d.b.h. There are 171 distinct species represented within this database. Some species grow in more than one region and tend to grow differently from one region to another owing to environmental and management differences. Thus, there are multiple equations for the same species that reflect those differences, and it is important to select the equation for the appropriate region. The UTD contains foliar biomass data that are fundamental to calculating leaf area, as well as tree biomass equations for carbon storage estimates. Also, a user guide illustrates application of the equations to calculate carbon stored over many years for tree species that were measured in multiple cities. The raw data and equations may be accessed and downloaded at http://dx.doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2016-0005.
Uses of Urban Tree Growth Equations
Information on urban tree growth is indispensable to modeling urban forest function and value. The economic, social, and ecological benefits of trees are directly related to their size, as indicated by leaf area, crown volume, and biomass (Scott et al. 1998, Stoff berg et al. 2010, Xiao et al. 2000a). Growth equations underpin the calculations produced by many computer models used in urban forestry, such as i-Tree, National Tree Benefit Calculator, OpenTreeMap, and ecoSmart Landscapes (fig. 1).
Urban tree growth and size data can assist municipal foresters because the costs for pruning and removing trees tends to increase with tree size (O’Brien et al. 1992). For example, accurate projections of size-related costs for pruning species that require frequent care can improve budgeting. Sanders et al. (2013) noted that managers are hindered in developing tree removal and replacement plans and obtaining public acceptance when they lack empirical data on each species’ useful

service life. Without maximum size end points that are linked to constraints posed by the designed space, it is difficult to plan for phased removal and replacement that minimizes liability and maintains continuous tree canopy cover.
Knowledge of maximum tree size can inform tree selection to avoid conflicts between tree roots and nearby sidewalks or between crowns and utility lines (Randrup et al. 2001). Conversely, field-based predictions of crown projection area at 10, 15, and 20 years after planting can help designers select species to achieve targeted tree canopy cover in parking lots (McPherson 2001). Other examples of design and management issues influenced by tree growth and size include spacing between trees and in relation to building infrastructure, soil volumes required, irrigation demands, and pest-control and fertilization dosages (fig. 2). A better understanding of tree allometry by landscape architects and arborists can potentially reduce management costs, improve functional performance, and increase the benefits derived from healthy and sustainable urban forests (Clark et al. 1997).
Allometric equations that describe the bole and crown growth of different urban tree species can be used to create more realistic animations that compress years of growth into seconds (Peper et al. 2007). Landscape architects and planners are increasingly using three-dimensional models to visualize alternative landscapes (fig. 3). Incorporating empirically derived allometric equations to simulate development of the tree canopy can allow designers to anticipate spatial impacts and potential conflicts between maturing trees and other design elements (Larsen and Kristoffersen 2002). 2

Analyses of allometric and site data can find correlations between variables that will inform management (Grabosky and Gilman 2004). Moreover, tree size and age data can be used to form local baselines for cities. Repeated measurements of the same trees can identify trends in growth, survival, and replacement. By building upon these baseline data, long-term tree growth and demographic studies could fill important knowledge gaps in urban forestry.
Development of Urban Tree Growth Equations
Although tree growth is the result of very complex processes, growth equations capture changes in tree size with age in a surprisingly simple and accurate way. Growth equations contain two components that reflect the interaction of two opposing biological forces. The expansion component is responsible for the increase in the increment with age, and growth expansion is proportional to the current size of the tree (Zeide 1993). The growth-decline component is responsible for the decrease in the increment with age from constraints imposed by internal (aging) and external (stress) factors. Hence, growth equations bring together these two biological forces over the entire lifespan of a species. Because tree growth reflects the unique genetic traits of trees, as well as their responses to environmental trends and management, no one growth equation suits all species, sites, or growth processes. Growth equations are best applied when the scope of analysis includes many individual trees over long time periods.
Growth equations are traditionally associated with rural forests, where they provide quantitative guidelines for planting, thinning, and harvesting. Growth equations for forest trees may not be directly transferable to open-grown urban trees because they grow and partition bole, branch, twig, and leaf biomass differently (Anderegg et al. 2015, Nowak 1994a, Peper and McPherson 1998) (fig. 4). For example, in forests, tree crowns compete for limited space and may not reach their maximum expansion potential (Martin et al. 2012).
The development of allometric equations for urban open-grown trees has been sporadic. Fleming (1988) measured trees in New Jersey having full healthy crowns to develop linear relationships between d.b.h., height, crown spread, and age. Frelich (1992) measured only healthy trees (12 species, 221 trees total) growing in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, to predict linear size relationships. Nowak (1994b) developed an allometric equation for leaf area based on data from park trees in Chicago. Tree dimensions and leaf area were predicted

for the most abundant street tree species in Modesto and Santa Monica, California (Peper et al. 2001a, 2001b). In New Haven, Connecticut, Troxel et al. (2013) developed allometric equations for predicting d.b.h. from age and height, crown diameter, and crown volume from d.b.h. for early growth (15 years) of 10 street tree species.
Outside of North America, growth equations have been developed for street-side Tilia species in Copenhagen, Denmark (Larsen and Kristoffersen 2002), and T. cordata Mill., Fraxinus excelsior L. and Aesculus hippocastanum L. in Warsaw, Poland (Lukaszkiewicz and Kosmala 2008, Lukaszkiewicz et al. 2005). Predictive models were developed from allometric data for five street tree species in northeastern Italy by Semenzato et al. (2011). Stoff berg et al. (2008) used allometric relationships between age and d.b.h., height, and crown diameter to estimate dimensions at 10, 15, and 30 years after planting for three street tree species in Tshwane, South Africa. The allometric equations from all these studies reflect the effects of local site conditions, management practices, and growing season on growth, limiting application outside their region of origin (fig. 5).

Upper and lower lines represent height and height to first branch, respectively. Cheyenne green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) have 55 percent of the Fort Collins’ ash leaf area after 60 years.

Origin of These Urban Tree Growth Equations
For this report, the need to develop urban tree growth equations was first prompted by a grant that required calculating the 40-year annual stream of carbon stored by urban trees across the United States (McPherson and Simpson 1999). Measured data were lacking for most regions. Following Frelich (1992), d.b.h. was predicted using a power function with age and two constants (fig. 6). Coefficients were adjusted for different regions based on the number of frost-free days, and calibrated with the few data points that were available. This absence of reliable data led the U.S. Forest Service to undertake a 14-year campaign that measured more than 14,000 trees in cities across the United States. Crews began systematically sampling street and park trees in 1998. The initial tree growth equations were used with numerical models to calculate the annual stream of benefits associated with energy effects, air pollutant uptake and emissions, carbon storage, rainfall interception, and effects on property values (Maco and McPherson 2003, McPherson et al. 2005).

This work evolved into the i-Tree Streets (formerly STRATUM) software program and a series of related products that are highlighted below. • Sixteen regional tree guides quantified the long-term benefits and costs
for trees and provided information on program design and implementation, optimal configurations of trees, tree species for different situations, techniques for successful establishment of new trees, and sources of funding and technical assistance. These technical reports provide regionally specific science-based information for elected officials, planners, landscape architects and contractors, urban foresters, arborists, and nonprofit tree organizations (McPherson et al. 2000, 2010; Peper et al. 2009; Vargas et al. 2007) (http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/topics/urban_forestry/products/ tree_guides.shtml). • Seventeen municipal forest resource assessments combined results of citywide street/park tree inventories with benefit-cost modeling to describe structure, function, and value, along with resource management needs (McPherson and Simpson 2002, McPherson et al. 1999) (http://www.fs.fed. us/psw/topics/urban_forestry/products/mfra.shtml).

In 2008, the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station received funding from CAL FIRE to develop a tree carbon calculator to predict carbon stored by tree planting, following guidance in the Urban Forest Greenhouse Gas Reporting Protocol (Climate Action Reserve 2008). The Center for Urban Forestry Research (CUFR) Tree Carbon Calculator was released in 2010 and incorporated revised tree growth equations for the most abundant tree species in each of 16 U.S. climate zones (http://www.fire.ca.gov/resource_mgt/resource_mgt_urbanforestry).
This report presents the third, most recent and most complete sets of growth equations. The equations presented in this report were developed using more sophisticated statistical methods than before. For example, in the first studies, logarithmic regression and exponential models predominantly provided the best fits to measured data (Peper et al. 2001a, 2001b). In these equations, the best model fits ranged from polynomials (from simple linear to quartic) to logarithmic and exponential models (Peper et al. 2014). The newest equations have been integrated with numerical models of tree benefits in the ecoSmart Landscapes software (McPherson et al. 2014).
Limitations of Urban Tree Growth Equations
The biophysical, social, and economic forces that influence tree growth are highly variable within and among cities. Consequently, large sample sizes are required to fully capture overall growth trends within a species. In rural forests, relatively uniform growing conditions allow foresters to create site indices and generate site-specific growth equations for each species in the stand. This has not been done for trees in the urban forest because of their heterogeneity and limited resources for measurements.
Management practices can differ widely among the arborists and amateurs who plant and maintain trees. For example, pruning practices such as topping trees to reduce their height can affect tree growth and size (fig. 7). Crown damage from storms, pests, drought, and other stressors can result in highly variable height and diameter dimensions among trees of the same species and age. The presence of trees with dimensions that deviate from the norm can result in growth equations that produce less reliable size predictions.

GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PSW-GTR-253

Another limitation to the development of robust growth equations for urban trees is the difficulty of obtaining accurate age data for older trees. In the context of this research, tree age refers to years after planting, not after germination or propagation. Records of planting dates seldom extend beyond 30 to 40 years. Similarly, detecting the presence and size of individual trees using high-resolution aerial imagery becomes difficult prior to 1990. As a result, predictions of urban tree dimensions reflect the increasing uncertainty about true tree age compounded by naturally increasing variability associated with aging (fig. 8).
Allometric equations for urban tree species have many valuable uses. Although researchers have developed such equations, their range of application and predictive power are limited by small sample sizes, few species, young and excellent-condition trees only, and narrow geographic range. This research overcomes some of these limitations by presenting 365 sets of allometric equations for the most abundant tree

(in centimeters) and crown-diameter data (in meters) the variability is greatest for trees with d.b.h. in the 20-to 60-cm range. Accordingly, the prediction interval increases with d.b.h. size (Peper et al. 2014).

species in cities from around the United States. Also, this report illustrates application of these growth equations by calculating the predicted amounts of carbon dioxide stored over 50 years by the same species of trees growing in cities with different climates, soils, and management practices.
Foliar Biomass
Accurate estimates of leaf area are fundamental to modeling physiological and functional processes of urban forests. For example, the volume of rainfall intercepted by a tree crown is related to the amount of leaf area as well as the foliage surface saturation storage capacity, both of which are species dependent (Xiao et al. 2000b). Leaf area is used to calculate dry deposition rates of air pollutants and emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) for different tree species (Benjamin and Winer 1998). Hirabayashi et al. (2012) used a regression equation to estimate leaf area that uses crown dimensions and a species-specific shade factor (Nowak 1996). Bottom-up modeling approaches such as this calculate interception, uptake, and emissions of individual trees and scale-up these estimates to the region. This approach allows for modeling future effects of different management strategies.
The accuracy, precision, efficiency, and other practical considerations associated with four methods of estimating leaf area of open-grown urban trees were evaluated with a completely destructive sample of 50 trees (Peper and McPherson 2003). The color digital image processing method was the only method to produce estimates within 25 percent of mean true leaf area and meet additional requirements for precision and efficient use in urban settings. The regression equation that is currently applied in the i-Tree Eco dry deposition model (Cabaraban et al. 2013, Nowak et al. 2014) had the lowest correlation of the four approaches.
Isoprene and other BVOC emission factors are important components of air quality models because tree emissions can occur at levels that influence atmospheric composition (Geron et al. 2001). Isoprene emission rates of different plant species range from <0.1 to >100 µg · m-2 · h-1. Species-specific emission factor data have been summarized and measurement techniques detailed (Ortega et al. 2008). Allometric relationships between leaf area, fresh and dry leaf weight make it possible to estimate values of these important model parameters from measurements on a related parameter. For example, emission factors are expressed in units for dry foliar weight (g-C · kg-1 · dry leaf day-1). To scale-up the emission calculation to an entire tree, one can estimate its total dry foliar weight if the kilogram of dry leaf to square meter leaf area is known, as well as total tree leaf area. Similarly, if total tree foliar dry weight is unknown but the foliar dry weight to fresh weight ratio is known, total tree foliar dry weight can be estimated by sampling and weighing leaves in quadrats within the crown volume.
11

GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PSW-GTR-253
The UTD described in this report contains allometric equations that can be used to calculate tree leaf area by d.b.h. for selected species. Also, it contains species-specific ratios for foliar dry weight to fresh weight and dry weight to leaf area. The UTD is the most extensive compilation of these ratios for urban trees published to date.
Woody Biomass
Tree species, wood density, moisture content, and size data (d.b.h. and height) are used with biomass equations and other information (e.g., condition) to calculate tree wood volume and stored carbon. Because wood densities and moisture contents can vary within and among species, there is error associated with the use of average values in allometric equations (Yoon et al. 2013). Volumetric equations calculate the aboveground green wood volume of a tree using species d.b.h. and height. Total biomass and carbon stored are estimated by converting green volume to dry weight using density conversion factors, adding the biomass stored belowground, and converting total biomass to carbon.
Direct equations, a second type of equation, yield the aboveground dry weight of a tree, eliminating the need for density conversion factors. Direct equations are very site specific, and they assume that wood density value does not change. This is a limitation if the equations are to be applied across a variety of trees, sites, and climate zones because wood density varies within a tree and by site. Our focus has been on using volume equations and species-specific wood density factors obtained from the Global Wood Density Database (Zanne et al. 2009). This allows the user to select a volume equation from a species whose structure most resembles the structure of the subject tree, then apply the density factor for the subject tree’s species.
Destructive sampling methods used to develop biomass equations in forests are occasionally used in urban forests, such as for Quercus virginiana Mill. and Q. laurifolia Michx. in Florida (Timilsina et al. 2014). Pillsbury et al. (1998) took nondestructive manual measurements of 15 species of street and park trees in California. Terrestrial LiDAR was used to develop biomass equations for 11 species in Fort Collins, Colorado (Lefsky and McHale 2008). A laser dendrometer was used for measurements on the five most abundant street tree species in Daegu, Korea (Yoon et al. 2013).
Application of forest-based biomass equations for tree species is less desirable than applying urban-based equations because of differences in tree architecture (McHale et al. 2009, Yoon et al. 2013). Nowak (1994c) recommended multiplying forest-based equation results by a correction factor of 0.80 because they overestimated actual biomass. However, McHale et al. (2007) found that standard application of the correction factor may lead to underestimates of biomass at the city

scale. Yoon et al. (2013) found that the urban-based biomass equation for Zelkova serrata (Thunb.) Makino produced estimates 4.7 to 6.0 times lower than one from plantation-grown trees, but was similar to the equation for urban Zelkova in California (Pillsbury et al. 1998). However, the allometric equations for open- and plantation-grown Ginkgo biloba L. were similar, implying greater architectural and genetic uniformity for this species.
Urban general equations have been developed as an alternative to applying species-specific equations when many species do not have an equation. Aguaron and McPherson (2012) compiled urban general equations from 26 urban-based equations that were species specific. They found that these direct general equations underestimated carbon storage relative to species-specific equations at the city scale. Differences between the structure of the species used to generate the urban general equations and the city’s tree population may be responsible. Yoon et al. (2013) compiled species-specific urban equations into a general equation and found that the difference in values estimated using species-specific values was less than 1 percent at the citywide scale. However, Aguaron and McPherson’s (2012) general equation for urban broadleaf species overestimated aboveground biomass by 50 percent. The uncertainty associated with application of urban general equations underscores the need for more urban equations that are species specific. For improved accuracy, the urban general equations in this UTD are volume equations that allow users to apply species-specific dry weight density factors.

Climate Zones and Reference Cities
The United States was divided into 16 national climate zones by aggregation of 45 Sunset climate zones (Brenzel 1997). The climate zone map demarcates each zone (fig. 9). Sunset zones were aggregated based on factors that influence plant distribution, such as length of growing season and minimum temperature, as well as cooling degree days (CDD) and heating degree days (HDD), which are indicators of the potential effects of trees on building heating and cooling loads (table 1). The CDD and HDD values are the summation of degrees of the average temperature per day above and below 18.5 °C (65 °F) for the year, respectively (McPherson 2010).
Figure 9—Climate zones were aggregated from 45 Sunset climate zones into 16 zones. Each zone has a reference city where tree growth data were collected. Sacramento, California, was added as a second reference city (with Modesto) to the Inland Valleys zone.

Urban Tree Database and Allometric Equations
“Reference city,” refers to one city selected for intensive study within each climate zone (McPherson 2010). Data were collected for a second reference city in the Inland Valleys climate zone, Sacramento, California, because tree growth data were required for several ongoing studies. Criteria for selecting a reference city included (1) an updated computerized tree inventory with location information for each tree (20,000 to 250,000 street/park trees); (2) information to accurately age a sample of about 900 trees by the city forester; (3) large, old trees present in the community; and (4) an aerial lift truck available for 1 week to sample foliage.
Species and Tree Sampling
The trees sampled in each reference city were obtained from the computerized tree inventory. First, the inventory was cleaned to remove stumps, dead trees (shown as scheduled for removal), and vacant sites. It was sorted by species to identify the most abundant species for sampling. About 20 of the most abundant species were selected for sampling in each city. Appendix 1 lists the number of trees of each species sampled in each city (available for download as table S2). The sampled species accounted for 50 to 95 percent of all trees in the municipal tree inventories. To obtain information spanning the life cycle of each of the predominant tree species, a stratified random sample was drawn. The sample was stratified into nine diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) classes (0 to 7.6, 7.6 to 15.2, 15.2 to 30.5, 30.5 to 45.7, 45.7 to 61.0, 61.0 to 76.2, 76.2 to 91.4, 91.4 to 106.7, and >106.7 cm). Thirty to 70 trees of each species were randomly selected to survey, about 5 to 10 trees in each d.b.h. class. Smaller samples of 30 trees were drawn for small-growing species such as Prunus spp. and Malus spp. Seventy trees were drawn for species with individuals represented in all size classes. An equal number of alternative trees were selected as replacement trees in the event that the originally sampled trees could not be located.
Although 30 to 70 trees were randomly selected for sampling each species, the final samples ranged from 22 to 79 trees. The lower number resulted when the original and replacement trees could not be located. The higher numbers occurred when the sample trees were actually in a different size class than reported in the inventory. These trees were measured in case viable replacements could not be found. In fact, replacements were found and sample numbers became greater than expected.

Tree Data Collection
Each variable in the UTD, as well as its definition, abbreviation, and potential use, is listed in table 2. Protocols for data collection are in appendix 2. Metrics recorded for each tree sampled included species, address/location, d.b.h. (to nearest 1.0 cm by tape), tree crown, and bole height (to nearest 0.5 m by clinometer or sonar measuring device), crown diameter in two directions (parallel and perpendicular to nearest street to nearest 0.5 m by sonar measuring device) (table 2). Observational information was recorded on crown shape, land use, distance and direction from nearest air-conditioned/heated building, car shade, and conflicts with utility lines. Other data are presently being analyzed and will be added to the UTD upon publication including sidewalk damage, site type, the amount of planting space, condition of wood and foliage, whether the tree is city or privately managed, maintenance needs, and photograph numbers for the one or two photographs that were taken of each tree and processed in the laboratory to calculate leaf area and crown volume. This photographic method is described in Peper and McPherson (2003) and was found more accurate than other techniques (±25 percent of actual leaf area) for open-grown trees. The tree growth equations and raw data collected for each tree are available for download in the online supplement http://dx.doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2016-0005.
Tree age was determined from local residents, the city’s urban forester, street and home construction dates, historical planting records, and aerial and historical photos. In two cases, extra effort was required to obtain age information. Tree coring was used in Queens, New York City, to estimate planting dates instead of relying solely on historical research. Unlike other cities, where streets are lined with trees of the same age because they were all planted at the time of development, street trees in Queens were of all ages because several episodes of planting had ocurred. Dendrologists at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory’s Tree Ring Laboratory cored 150 randomly sampled trees to establish mean tree age. These trees represented a subsample of the original 910 sample trees. One to two trees in size classes 2 through 9 were cored for each species. Cores were analyzed in the lab and tree age established. Urban foresters provided tree ages for an additional 104 sample trees in d.b.h classes 8 and 9 (91.4 to 106.7 cm and >106.7 cm), based on building records, and 34 trees in d.b.h. classes 1 and 2 based on planting records. These data were pooled with ring-count data to develop regressions based on the mean age for each d.b.h. size class. Thus, the online data for Queens, New York City, shows two sets of data, one for data directly collected from each tree and one for tree ages collected from a combination of coring a subsample of the measured trees and aging information provided by New York City Parks and Recreation. Although more accurate aging of trees is required for that region, equations relationships between d.b.h. and parameters other than age reflect actual measured data. 18

In the Lower Midwest zone, the age of 337 of the 911 sampled trees was identified across d.b.h. ranges through local resources. This represented enough data to develop age to d.b.h equations for 12 of the 20 species sampled. For the remaining eight species, analysis was run testing available measured data with the same species measured in the other 15 climate regions to find the closest relationships. Closest relationships were found for Catalpa speciosa and Juglans nigra with same species in Boise, Idaho; with Magnolia grandiflora, Picea pungens, Pyrus sp., and Ulmus pumila in Fort Collins, Colorado; with Celtis occidentalis in Minneapois, Minnesota; and with Pinus strobus in Queens, New York City. However, these relationships were based on a comparison of minimal data from Indianapolis and should not be construed to be accurate until additional data are available for analysis from Indianapolis. These data are presented in the online UTD database and annotated in the “Notes” column as to origin. Age to d.b.h. equations shown here for these eight species, therefore, should be regarded as first-order approximations until more definitive data are available. For these reasons, tree age is probably the least accurate metric in this database.

GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PSW-GTR-253
Foliar Sampling and Data Collection
For each species, one to three trees—typical of species in age, size, and condition— were selected for foliar sampling. Sampling was done from a bucket truck that required room to maneuver to reach the areas of the crown to be sampled. Foliar samples were taken at different locations within each tree crown to capture differences between sun and shade, as well as juvenile and mature foliage. By sampling leaves of different size and maturity, it was possible to obtain relationships between leaf area and dry weight that were representative of the tree’s foliar biomass over time. One set of 10 random quadrat (a cube 30 by 30 by 30 cm) samples were clipped from each tree—three from the lower one-third of the crown, four from the middle section, and three from the top one-third. Within each crown stratum, at least one sample was from the outer, middle, and inner portions. Leaves and stems were clipped along the outside of the cube, and each sample was stored in a labeled ziplock bag. The bags were stored in an ice chest and shipped by overnight delivery to the cold-storage site in Davis, California.
The foliar samples were processed to develop relationships between leaf area and foliar biomass for each tree species. The leaves in each bag were separated from stems and twigs, then weighed (fresh weight) and run through the leaf area meter to obtain the sample’s total surface area (leaf area). The foliage was returned to the paper bag and dried in an oven at 65 °C (149 °F) for 3 days (72 hours minimum). On the fourth day, the bag was removed from the oven and weighed (dry weight). The bag was returned to the oven and dried 24 hours then removed from the oven and weighed. If the bag weighed less than its previous weight, it was returned to the oven and dried. This process was repeated until the weight no longer changed. The fresh weight, dry weight, and leaf area were recorded for the foliar samples in each of the 10 bags per species. Leaf area to dry weight and fresh weight to dry weight relationships were calculated for each species using standard descriptive statistics. Resulting data are shown in appendix 3.

Chapter 3: Development of Tree Growth Equations

Six models were tested for seven parameters at four weights. Predicted parameters included the following: using tree age to predict diameter at breast height (d.b.h.); and using d.b.h. to predict tree height, crown height, crown diameter, and leaf area. In addition, crown diameter was used to predict d.b.h. for use with remote sensing imagery and age predicted from d.b.h. for use in backcasting. Prior to analysis, raw data points from each region were plotted to examine potential outliers. Following methods described by Martin et al. (2012), we eliminated from our analysis those observations identified on residual plots that were greater than two units larger than the general spread of observations for that parameter. Models tested included four polynomial models (linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic), as well as log-log and exponential:

Where yi is the measurement of tree i, a is the mean intercept, b is the mean slope, xi is the d.b.h. or age of tree i, is the random error for tree i with j ~N(0,σ2), σ2 is the variance of the random error, and wi is a known weight that takes on one of the following forms: wi = 1, wi = 1/√xi , wi = 1/xi , wi = 1/x2.
Analysis was conducted using SAS® 9.2 MIXED procedure (SAS 2008). The
bias-corrected Aikaike’s information criterion (AICc) was used to compare and rank the models because of smaller sample sizes (Akaike 1974). The models with
the “best” fit as indicated by having the smallest AICc were selected. Additional steps were needed to obtain comparable AICc values for log-log and exponential models (eqs. 7 and 8). Otherwise AICc values would not be comparable across all models. Multiplying by the geometric mean allows the AICc values to be compared with the models where yi is not transformed (Draper and Smith 1998).

The resulting best fitting model is listed for each measured species and region in the online supplement, table S6 (an example is shown in app. 4), with the measured parameter, predicted tree component, model weight, equation name, the coefficients to use in each model, the minimum and maximum values to estimate between, mean square error, sample size, adjusted R2, the raw data range, and the degrees of freedom. The model weights are already accounted for in the equation coefficients. The equation name represents the general form of the equation, the details of which are in table 3. Note that log-log and exponential models require an input for mean-squared error (mse), which is listed in table 7 (app. 4) column “c or mse” (i.e., do not calculate and use sigma2).
For palms, there is no discernable relationship between age and d.b.h. In contrast, age is an adequate predictor of tree height. Therefore, equations were developed to predict palm height from age, and subsequently, to predict other parameters such as biomass from palm height.

Urban Tree Database and Allometric Equations

An important constraint to consider when applying the growth equations to measured tree data is that equations predicting d.b.h. from age may produce negative values for young ages. Negative values in d.b.h. estimates may cause continued problems for predicting tree height and other variables from d.b.h. These values should take on the first instance of a positive value.
In the Urban Tree Database (UTD), two sets of data ranges are reported. One shows the actual range of the data collected and is labelled “Data min” and “Data max.” To reduce the risk of overextending the application of the equations, we report application ranges for the equations used to predict each parameter. The “Apps min” and “Apps max” range informs users on a reasonable range for use of the equations—sometimes extending beyond collected data points, and sometimes not reaching those points. Values extending beyond the range of collected data were considered because there was sufficient knowledge of how large trees grow from measurements taken in local parks and neighborhoods.
Database Description
The core of the UTD consists of two large data tables that can be downloaded in ASCII format through the online supplement. The first table (app. 3 and available for download as table S5) shows summarized results from the foliar sampling for each species and region. The second table displays equations and coefficients for predicting tree-growth parameters by species and predicted parameter (table S6). An excerpt from table S6 for two species in one climate zone is shown in appendix 4. A User Guide (app. 5) provides step-by-step instructions and examples for applying the growth equations to trees of interest using the core data tables. In addition, appendix 5 demonstrates how to estimate dry weight biomass and carbon using allometric equations (tables S7 and S8). Table S9 provides an expanded list

of dry-weight biomass density factors for common urban species. Lastly, a case study demonstrates differences in d.b.h., tree height, and total carbon across the different climate zones, highlighting the importance of developing region-specific growth models.
Data Limitations and Future Research Needs
Accurately predicting d.b.h and tree height leads to better estimates of total carbon storage and carbon sequestration. This section describes where uncertainty is greatest and additional research is needed to improve estimates.
Tails— In the context of estimating tree size, as well as carbon storage and sequestration for applications such as calculating tree benefits, it is important to continue to improve the accuracy of the equations at the extreme ends of the age spectrum. With limited measurements at the extreme ends of the age spectrum, there is the risk of a few extreme points driving the equation form selection. It is particularly important to sample from larger/older trees because small changes in growth equations can cause large absolute differences in carbon estimates. As trees age, the differences typically increase owing to temporal autocorrelation and differences in equation form. Each additional data point obtained at the upper age range is therefore critical for increasing accuracy of growth and volumetric equations.
Age— Sampling from large trees does not guarantee the addition of old trees to the database. One practical limitation of the age-to-d.b.h.-regression approach (from size curves instead of real growth curves) is that age data are often difficult to acquire. The lack of age information can limit the use of predictions in applications. For example, not all of the large trees randomly selected for coring in New York City were successfully cored. The length of the coring instrument and pockets of decay inside the tree limited the effectiveness of coring and thus makes this research dependent on people recording tree planting dates. Predictions for d.b.h. from the best model for Platanus × acerifolia in New York City estimated an end d.b.h. growth at and end d.b.h. of 61 cm as predicted from age, even though the largest tree measured was 165 cm d.b.h. This occurred because the largest tree was not cored successfully. Until additional data are collected to represent a larger and more robust sample of tree ages and sizes for each species, the level of inference drawn from these model fits should be limited by staying within the Apps min and Apps max ranges listed in the database.
26

Urban Tree Database and Allometric Equations
Size— Selecting a robust sample of trees that captures a range of sizes is important for smaller-growing species as well. We found that smaller-growing species, particularly Prunus and Lagerstroemia were problematic for model-fitting. Typically, there were few specimens smaller than 7.6 cm d.b.h. and many in the 15.2 to 30.5 cm d.b.h. range. In addition, because these trees were often pruned by homeowners, crowns rarely followed a more natural form, resulting in a large variety of forms and heights. This problem of form manipulation was even greater with Lagerstroemia, which also might be present as either a single- or multistemmed plant. Lagerstroemia were often pollarded every year, affecting height and crown measurements as well as slowing d.b.h. growth.
It was also more difficult to find good model fits for several of the small- and medium-growing conifers like Pinus brutia, P. edulis, and P. contorta because there were few representatives in the 0 to 15.2 cm size class or, as in the case of P. edulis, most representatives were in the 10.2 to 30.5 cm d.b.h. range with few samples available below or above that.
Palms— Palms represent another sampling gap. In the UTD (app. 4), palms do not have mse or adjusted R2 because the equations were not calculated from measurements, but from information provided by palm nurseries and experts in the region. This was done because the majority of palms were transplanted at anywhere from 5 to 40 years of age, and d.b.h. recorded in tree inventories showed no relationship to other crown dimensions. Also, city foresters had very little information on the ages of palms at time of planting. Although the UTD contains measurements for more species than ever reported, much more information is needed for truly accurate growth representation within regions of the country.
Volumetric equations— The results from the case study (app. 5) demonstrate the differences in growth patterns among climate zones/regions. Besides improving on the growth equation database, there is work to be done to expand volumetric equations. As described in the user guide (app. 5), the volumetric equations used to predict tree volume from measured parameters are not region specific, because differences between regions have not yet been tested and localized equations have not been developed. Developing a more extensive database of volumetric equations for open-grown urban tree species is a high-priority research need.

Urban Tree Database and Allometric Equations
Chapter 4: Conclusions
Information on urban tree growth underpins models such as i-Tree that calculate effects of trees on the environment and human well-being. Data about tree growth are used to create realistic animations that depict landscape change over decades. Maximum tree size and other growth data are used by urban forest managers, landscape architects, and planners to select trees most suitable to the amount of growing space, thereby reducing costly future conflicts between trees and infrastructure. Growth data may be used to characterize relationships between growth and influencing factors such as site conditions and stewardship practices. Despite the importance of tree growth data to the science and practice of urban forestry, our knowledge is scant. For example, data have been lacking to specify the range of bole and crown dimensions for an open-grown red oak (Quercus rubra) tree exhibiting “normal” growth in New York City.
Over a period of 14 years, the U.S. Forest Service recorded data from a consistent set of measurements on over 14,000 trees in 17 U.S. cities. This network of cities represents municipal forests with different climates, forest structures, and management histories and practices. Key information collected for each tree species includes bole and crown size, location, and age. From this Urban Tree Database (UTD), 365 sets of tree-growth equations were developed for the predominant species. Although the UTD contains measurements for more species than ever reported, much more information is needed to better model tree growth within regions of the country. Tree planting dates are seldom recorded but remain fundamental to establishing relations between age and size. Capturing the range of ages that exist within the population promises to improve the lower and upper ends of the growth predictions where most of the uncertainty currently resides. Also, the value of the UTD can be expanded with new information on site conditions (e.g., soil type, microclimate, amount of growing space) and management practices (e.g., pruning dose, irrigation regime). With such information, analysts can better predict the effects of practices on tree growth and the services their trees provide.
The UTD is not a static repository. Already remeasurements have been conducted on originally measured trees in two cities (Claremont and Santa Monica, California) to update these equations and better understand the long-term demographics of street tree populations. These new data, as well as contributions from other researchers, will be incorporated into the UTD. Continued updating will ensure that the UTD remains a valuable resource for urban and community forestry.

GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PSW-GTR-253
Appendix 2: Field Data Collection Protocols
The following data will be recorded for each tree (note: highlighted fields 1 through 9 will be uploaded from inventory onto your palmtop and are for locating trees. You will collect data for the remaining items: 1. TreeID—from inventory, unique number assigned to each tree by city in
inventory. 2. SpCode—four- to six-letter code consisting of the first two letters of the
genus name and the first two letters of the species name followed by two optional letters to distinguish two species with the same four-letter code. 3. AddressNum–from inventory, street number of building where tree is located. 4. Street–from inventory, the name of the street on which the tree is located– from inventory. 5. Side—from inventory, indicates side of building or lot on which the tree is located (see fig. 10): F = front M = median S = side P = park 6. Cell—from inventory, the cell number where the tree is located (1, 2, 3, etc). Obtain city inventory protocols to determine what order the trees are numbered in (e.g., sometimes they are assigned in driving direction or, alternatively, as street number increases, depending upon city). 7. OnStree—from inventory (omit if not included as a field in city’s inventory), for trees at corner addresses when the tree is actually on a cross street rather than the addressed street (see fig. 10). 8. FromStreet/ToStreet—from inventory, the names of the cross streets that form boundaries for trees lining unaddressed boulevards. For example, on boulevards that have no development adjacent to them, therefore no obvious parcel addressing, trees are typically numbered in order. By including closest cross streets in the inventory, one will not have to begin counting trees from No. 1 in order to locate No. 333, which is 10 blocks up the boulevard from No. 1.

9. DBHinv—the diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) from the city inventory, usually expressed as classes from one to nine, but class system specific to city. Sometimes expressed as d.h.h. to nearest inch or centimeter. Data are used to help locate the desired size of tree in the field for sampling.
10. Diameter at breast height—measure the d.b.h. (1.37 m) to nearest 0.1 cm (tape). Where possible for multistemmed trees forking below 1.37 m, measure above the butt flare and below the point where the stem begins forking. When this is not possible, measure diameter root collar (DRC) as described below. Saplings (d.b.h./DRC 2.54 to 12.5 cm) will be measured at 1.37 m unless falling under multistemmed/unusual stem categories requiring DRC measurements (per Forest Health Monitoring (FHM) Field Methods Guide).

49

GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PSW-GTR-253
DIAMETER at ROOT COLLAR–adapted from Forest Health and Monitoring (FHM) Field Methods Guide: For species requiring DRC, measure the diameter at the ground line or at the stem root collar, whichever is higher. For these trees, treat clumps of stems having a unified crown and common rootstock as a single tree; examples include mesquite and juniper. For multistemmed trees, compute and record a cumulative DRC (see below); record individual stem diameters and a stem status (live or dead) on a separate form or menu as required.
Measuring DRC: Before measuring DRC, remove the loose material on the ground (e.g., litter) but not mineral soil. Measure just above any swells present, and in a location where the diameter measurements are reflective of the volume above the stems (especially when trees are extremely deformed at the base).
Stems must be at least 0.3 m in length and 2.54 cm in diameter at breast height to qualify for measurement; stems that are missing owing to cutting or damage are not included in measurement.
Additional instructions for DRC measurements are illustrated in figure 11.
Computing and recording DRC: For all tally trees requiring DRC, with at least one stem 2.54 cm in diameter or larger at the root collar, DRC is computed as the square root of the sum of the squared stem diameters. For a single-stemmed DRC tree, the computed DRC is equal to the single diameter measured.
Use the following formula to compute DRC: DRC = SQRT [SUM (stem diameter2)] Round the result to the nearest 2.54 cm. For example, a multistemmed woodland tree with stems of 12.2, 13.2, 3.8, and 22.1 would be calculated as: DRC = SQRT (12.22 + 13.22 + 3.82 + 22.12) = SQRT (825.93) = 28.74 = 28.7 11. TreeHt—from ground level to treetop to nearest 0.5 m (omit erratic leader as shown in fig. 12 with rangefinder). 12. CrnBase—with rangefinder, average distance between ground and lowest foliage layer (omitting erratic branch) to nearest 0.5 m. 13. CDiaPar—(crown diameter) crown diameter measurement taken to the nearest 0.5 m parallel to the street. The occasional erratic branch should not be included (see fig. 13). 14. CDiaPerp—(crown diameter) crown diameter measurement taken to the nearest 0.5 m perpendicular to the treet. The occasional erratic branch should not be included (see fig. 13). 50

Appendix 3: Foliar Biomass
Table 6 shows the mean and standard deviations for dry-weight to fresh-weight ratios for foliar biomass and the average foliar biomass factors (gram of dry weight per square meter of leaf area) for each species and region. Average foliar biomass factors range from a low of 76.1 g/m2 for climate zone MidWst to a high of 222.7 g/ m2 for TpIntW. Across climate zones, there is a range of average foliar biomass factor values by species tree type from a high of 481.9 g/m2 in large conifer evergreen species to a low of 99.3 g/m2 in large broadleaf deciduous species. Within climate zones, there is also high variability, influenced by tree type. For example, although the average foliar biomass factor for NoCalC is 214.4 g/m2, the range is from a high of 659.7 g/m2 (driven by Sequoia sempervirens and Pinus radiata, both factors over 500.0 g/m2) to a low of 73.2 g/m2 Prunus cerasifera. It is important to note the sample number (n) and documented sampling notes when applying these data. Foliar samples were not collected in four of the reference cities (InlVal, InterW, PacfNW, SacVal).

GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PSW-GTR-253
Appendix 4: Growth Equation Coefficients and Application Information
Appendix 4 and the corresponding online supplement report the growth equation coefficients from the best fitting models for each species and region. Table 7 illustrates the parameters predicted by the growth equations for two species, ACME and ACPA, in the Northern California Coast climate zone. The full table of coefficients for all species measured in each reference city is available in table S6 of the online supplement.
Twelve combinations of equation forms and model weights were tested for predicting seven parameters for each species and region. Thirty-one percent of all region-species combinations are best-fit (as measured by AICc values) by log-log (primarily unweighted) equations, followed closely by polynomial quadratic (26 percent), cubic (22 percent), and linear (19 percent) equations (app. 4, table 8). However, there is considerable variation in best-fit equation form among measured and predicted parameter types. For example, d.b.h. to leaf area relationship are typically best described by a log-log relationship (72 percent of the best-fit models across species are log-log equations), while d.b.h. to age relationships are most frequently described by cubic equations (38 percent). There is also variation in best-fit model frequency based on tree type, such as evergreen or deciduous, large, medium or small, and broadleaf, conifer, or palm. For example, the relationship between d.b.h. and tree height is most frequently best fit with quadradic models (50 percent) in medium coniferous evergreen species, but small coniferous evergreen species are best fit with linear models (83 percent). Meanwhile, log-log models are the most frequently chosen models for medium broadleaf deciduous species (43 percent).

Appendix 5: User Guide
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the allometric equations to estimate tree component dimensions. Predicted parameters included using tree age to predict diameter at breast height (d.b.h.); using d.b.h. to predict tree height, crown height, crown diameter, and leaf area. In addition, crown diameter was used to predict d.b.h., and age from d.b.h. The guide is divided into sections based on the tree components that are to be estimated. In the first section, we show tree diameter, height, crown dimensions, and leaf area from d.b.h. and/or tree height. In the second section, we demonstrate how to estimate dry-weight biomass and carbon using the table of equations presented in appendix 5. Lastly, we present a case study that illustrates the importance of developing region-specific growth models.
Calculating Bole Diameter and Height, Crown Dimensions, and Leaf Area
Example 1. Calculating d.b.h. and tree height from tree age (d.b.h. and height not measured).
In this example, we aim to predict tree dimensions d.b.h., tree height, crown diameter, crown height, and leaf area for a 33-year-old Liquidambar styraciflua (American sweetgum) in the Northern California Coast (NoCalC) region.
Step 1. Look up the species and region specific age to d.b.h. equation in table S5 in the online supplement at http://dx.doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2016-0005. The equation name is “quad” for which the equation form is listed in table 3:
d.b.h. (Liquidambar styraciflua in NoCalC) = a + b × age + c × age2 d.b.h. = 2.80359 + 1.29151 × 33 + 0.00299 × (33)2 = 42.2 cm
Step 2. Calculate tree height (ht) from d.b.h. by looking up the equation name and coefficients in table S5 and equation form (cubic) in table 3:
ht (Liquidambar styraciflua in NoCalC) = a + b × dbh + c × dbh2 + d × dbh3 ht = 0.57478 + 0.62687 × 42.16 + (-0.00837) × (42.2)2 + 0.00004 × (42.2)3 = 15.1 m Having calculated tree d.b.h (and in some cases tree height), it is now possible to skip ahead to section 2 if the goal is to estimate dry-weight biomass and carbon storage/sequestration. To estimate other tree dimensions, continue with steps 3 through 6.
Step 3. Calculate crown diameter (cdia) from d.b.h. by looking up the equation name and coefficients in table S5 and equation form (cubic) in table 3:
cdia (Liquidambar styraciflua in NoCalC) = a + b × dbh + c × dbh2 cdia = 0.42238 + 0.29796 × 42.2 +(-0.00131) × 42.22 = 10.7 m
68

Urban Tree Database and Allometric Equations
Step 4. Calculate crown height (cht) from d.b.h. by looking up the equation name and coefficients in table S5 and equation form in table 3:
cht (Liquidambar styraciflua in NoCalC) = a + b × dbh + c × dbh2 + d × dbh3 cht = (-0.54095) + 0.53287 × 42.2 + (-0.00872) × 42.22+0.00005 × 42.23 = 10.2 m
Step 5. Calculate leaf area (la) from d.b.h. by looking up the equation name and coefficients in table S5 and equation form (log-log) in table 3:
la = e (a + b × ln (ln (dbh +1) + (mse/2)) la = e (-1.47634) + 5.49634×LN(LN(42.2+1) + (0.29671/2)) = 413.2 m2 where e is a mathematical constant equal to 2.71828182845904, the base of the natural logarithm.
Step 6. To calculate foliar biomass (fb), multiply leaf area (m2) from step 4 by the average foliar biomass factor (g/m2 leaf area) in appendix 3:
fb = leaf area × average foliar biomass factor fb = 413.2 m2 × 125.75 (g/m2) = 51959.9 g
Estimating Dry-Weight Biomass and Carbon
To estimate the aboveground volume of wood in a tree, measured tree size data are used with biomass equations. While the growth equations are region-specific, biomass equations are not. Biomass equations are presented for 26 open-grown urban trees species (table 9). Most of these equations are compiled from literature sources described in the table, while the general equations (Urb Gen Broadleaf and Urb Gen Conifer) were developed through data collection and analyses. To be consistent with equations used in the Urban Forest Project Protocols (Climate Action Reserve 2008) for carbon projects, mass is not included in the formulations. All urban equations predict aboveground volume in square meters per tree. To convert from volume to dry-weight (DW) biomass, the predicted volume is multiplied by a DW density factor (table 9).
In addition to equations developed specifically for urban trees, biomass equations have been adapted from literature on rural forest biomass and applied for use in the urban setting (table 10). These equations may produce either volume or DW biomass directly. Equations predicting DW biomass directly do not need to be multiplied by a DW density factor.
Complete listings of equations are available in tables 9 and 10 (downloadable as tables S6 and S7). All equations are listed in an Excel-ready form so they may be copied and pasted into an Excel cell. Measurements required for using the biomass equations are either d.b.h. and tree height, or d.b.h. alone. If data availability permits, it is recommended that users select the d.b.h. and height equations over the d.b.h. only equations as they tend to produce more accurate results, particularly for trees with crowns that have been heavily pruned or topped.

(2009) first, but if not available, then look it up in the Global Wood Density Database (Zeng 2003).

Urban Tree Database and Allometric Equations
We developed two general volume equations from the urban species equations, one for urban broadleaf species and one for conifers. These equations can be used if the species of interest cannot be matched taxonomically or through wood form to the species listed in the tables of biomass equations derived from urban or rural forests (table 10). The general equations predict cubic meters of fresh-wood volume. Fresh-wood volume is then multiplied by the species’ DW density factor to obtain aboveground DW biomass. The urban general equations require looking up a dryweight density factor (in Jenkins et al. 2004 first, but if not available then the Global Wood Density Database).
To estimate total carbon and stored carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents, dryweight biomass (either calculated directly or from fresh-wood volume) is converted using constants. The DW biomass is multiplied by 1.28 to incorporate belowground biomass (Husch et al. 2003, Tritton and Hornbeck 1982, Wenger 1984), multiplied by the constant 0.5 to convert to total carbon stored (Leith 1963, Whittaker et al. 1973), and multiplied by the constant 3.67 (molecular weight of CO2) to convert to total CO2 stored.
Dry-weight densities are unique to each tree species and can vary extensively among species. Volume equations can be applied to other species based on taxonomy if a species-specific DW density factor is not known. For example, because many of the species measured in each of the reference cities were not represented in tables 9 and 10, it was necessary to assign biomass equations to species for which there were no available data. Table 11 provides examples of species matching for volume or biomass estimation (see column “Equation Species Code” for species to which species without information are matched). If the form of the tree is completely different than any species listed, we recommend using the general equations for urban broadleaf and conifer trees and look up the speciesspecific dry-weight-wood density value in DRYAD, the Global Wood Density Database (Chave et al. 2005, Frangi and Lugo 1985, Harris et al. 1973, Higuchi et al. 2005, Jenkins et al. 2004, Pillsbury and Kirkley 1984, Ter-Mikaelian and Korzuhkhin 1997, Van et al. 2000, Vieilledent et al. 2012, Zanne et al. 2009, Zeng 2003) available as a downloadable Excel spreadsheet at http://datadryad.org/repo/ handle/10255/dryad.235.

Example 2. Calculating dry-weight biomass and carbon stored based on either calculated or measured d.b.h. and/or tree height.
Once d.b.h. and height have been measured or calculated (as in example 1), the next step entails using either d.b.h. or d.b.h. and height to calculate the dry-weight biomass. For species assigned biomass equations, skip to example 3. For species assigned volumetric equations, follow this example.
In this example, we continue with a sample tree Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum) located in the Northern California Coast region. It is 33 years of age and has an estimated d.b.h. equal to 42.2 cm and tree height equal to 15.3 m, as calculated in example 1.
Step 1. Select the equation for d.b.h. and height to calculate aboveground fresh wood volume (table 9). Fresh-wood volume in cubic meters (V) for a 15.3-m tall sweetgum with a 42.2-cm d.b.h. is calculated as:
V = 0.0000631 × (42.2) 2.31582 × (15.1) 0.41571 = 1.13 m3 Note that the volumetric equations are not region specific, so the fact that our sample tree is located in the Northern California Coast region does not play a role in this example. If the tree had not been measured and we were predicting d.b.h. and/ or ht from age or d.b.h., we would need to select a region-specific growth equation.
Step 2. Convert from fresh-wood volume to dry-weight biomass by multiplying V by the species-specific DW density factor, which for sweetgum is 460 kg/m3 (from table 9)
DW = 1.13 m3 × 460 kg/m3 = 519.80 kg
Step 3. Thus far, we have calculated the biomass for the aboveground portion of the tree. To convert from DW biomass to carbon stored, the belowground biomass should be incorporated. The biomass stored belowground is calculated by multiplying the DW biomass by 1.28:
Total DW = 519.80 kg × 1.28 = 665.34 kg
Step 4. Next, the DW biomass is converted into kilograms of carbon (C) by multiplying by the constant 0.5:
C = 665.34 kg × 0.5 = 332.67 kg
Step 5. Convert stored carbon into stored carbon dioxide (CO2) by multiplying by the constant 3.67 as follows:
CO2 = 332.67 kg × 3.67 = 1220.89 kg Note that in this case, results were rounded at each step. Users will achieve slightly different results when using Excel or programming language to calculate the final amounts.

Example 3. Estimating DW biomass directly from tree size parameters. In this variation of example 2, we measure a Liriodendron tulipifera, which has
a d.b.h. of 35.0 cm. Select the equation from table 10 for estimating the direct DW biomass of this species. The calculation is as follows:
DW = 0.0365 × (35.0)2.7324- e (-4.0813+5.8816/35.0) = 604.4 kg where e is a mathematical constant equal to 2.71828182845904. To estimate total DW, total carbon stored, and CO2 stored, continue with steps 3 through 5 in example 2.
Error in Predicting Future Growth, Carbon, and Biomass
The volume equations were developed from trees that may differ in size from the trees in the user’s sample or inventory. The d.b.h. ranges for trees sampled to develop the volume and biomass equations are listed in columns labelled “Dbh lower (cm)” and “Dbh upper (cm)” (tables 9 and 10). Applying the equations to trees with d.b.h. outside of this range may increase the prediction error. Tree growth as modelled or estimated by the user may deviate significantly from tree growth models generalized here. In general, it is better to err on the side of underestimating carbon stocks rather than overestimating. Recommended ways of evaluating the growth data presented here include contacting local arborists and other tree experts (e.g., university extension offices, city tree managers) or from repeated measurements of inventoried trees.
Case Study
To demonstrate the species-level differences in d.b.h., tree height, and total carbon across regions, we selected the top three species most commonly measured in the 17 reference cities (16 reference cities and SacVal): Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum), and Magnolia grandiflora (southern magnolia). We estimated the d.b.h., tree height, and total carbon at 10-year intervals up to the maximum age recommended for the application of the developed equations (i.e., “AppMax”). Silver maple was measured in 7 reference cities, southern magnolia in 8 cities, and sweetgum in 12 cities.
At age 40, the oldest age for which data were available across regions, the estimated total carbon stored in silver maple was between 378.1 kg in the Northeast and 4505.6 kg in the Midwest regions, an 11-fold difference (fig. 17). Estimated d.b.h range was between 34.8 cm in Northeast and 101.6 cm in the Midwest; tree height ranged from 13.3 m in Northeast and 23.4 m in Midwest (table 12). The growth patterns of silver maple are similar in three regions: Inland Valley, North, Tropical Interior West and Lower Midwest, where there is only a twofold difference at age 40. Over the same time period, the quickest accumulation of carbon in silver 80

maple occurred in the Midwest and South. Silver maple growing in the Northeast is on the lowest trajectory for carbon stored, amounting to only 1222.3 kg at the oldest age for which the growth equations could be applied, age 150.
Of the regions and reference cities in which sweetgum is planted abundantly, the highest amount of carbon stored was in the southeastern region of the United States followed by regions in California (Northern California Coast; Inland Valleys including Sacramento Valley; Inland Empire) (fig. 18). Sweetgum in the Northeast and Southern California Coast stored noticeably less carbon than in the other regions as trees grew older. At age 60, the difference between highest and lowest estimates of carbon storage was ninefold, ranging from 238.6 kg in Southern California Coast (d.b.h. = 37.3; tree height = 13.3 m) to 5451.5 kg in the South region (d.b.h. = 121.4 cm; tree height = 34.8 m (fig. 18; table 13).
The regional differences in total carbon stored by magnolia become evident within 30 years of planting, with trees in Central Florida, South (Piedmont), Coastal Plain, and Sacramento Valley increasing at a faster rate than in Southern California Coast, Northern California Coast, and Inland Valleys (fig. 19). It takes magnolia approximately 30 additional years in Northern California Coast to attain similar levels of total carbon storage amount as in Central Florida and South regions. By age 50, the oldest age for which estimates were available across regions, magnolia is

expected to accumulate six times more carbon in the Central Florida (1596.2 kg) than in the Inland Valleys region (271.9 kg), nearly a sixfold difference. Estimated d.b.h ranged from 41.2 cm (tree height = 12.2 m) in the Inland Valleys to 97.8 cm in Central Florida region (tree height = 15.7 m) (table 14).
Species that are highly abundant in the reference cities (i.e., silver maple, sweetgum, and magnolia) accumulated carbon at a higher rate in the southeastern regions of the Unites States, namely South, Central Florida, and Coastal Plain regions. The ability of trees to store a large amount of carbon in the southeastern United States is likely due in part to the combination of high precipitation (>1300 mm per year), high temperatures in the summer and relatively warm temperatures in the winter (cooling degree days [CDD] > 847; heating degree days [HDD] < 2000), and long growing seasons. Central Florida, for example, has low HDD and high CDD, signifying a warm climate year round, where cooling would be required in the summers, but heating would not be needed as much in the winter.
Another region in which our case study species have accumulated relatively large amounts of carbon is the Midwest. This is surprising owing to the shorter growing seasons and cooler temperatures. One factor that likely played a role was the lack of limitations on growing space in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Very few sites had visible limitations on growth. In contrast, in Queens, New York city, only 44 percent of the sites had no apparent limitations. The species analyzed in our case study accumulated consistently less carbon in Queens than in the other reference cities. Santa Monica, reference city for the Southern California Coast region, also had lower estimates of carbon storage by sweetgum, likely resulting from too heavy pruning owing to hazard potentials (e.g., trees planted very close to curbs on busy commercial boulevards) (personal communication, P. Peper). Additional regions that had lower total carbon storage were the Inland Empire, Inland Valleys, and Lower Midwest. Although the inland regions of California have many warm days conducive to plant growth, low precipitation can result in high evaporative demand. Prolonged drought stress can restrict tree growth and carbon storage (Anderegg et al. 2015). For example, in the Inland Valleys region, CDD is 3153 mm, but annual precipitation is only 315 mm, most of which comes during the leaf-off season.
