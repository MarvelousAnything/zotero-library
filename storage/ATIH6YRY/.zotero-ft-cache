The structure of scientific literature 
Publication Types 
Primary literature 
 
In the sciences, the primary literature: 
 
    presents or comments upon the first-hand results of research activities 
    often includes analyses of data collected in the field or the laboratory 
    is very current and highly specialized . 
 
Examples of primary literature in the sciences include: 
 
    research articles published in peer-reviewed journals 
    More about peer review 
    Identifying peer-reviewed primary research articles 
    dissertations and theses 
    technical reports 
    conference proceedings 
 
Grey Literature: Dissertations and theses, technical reports, conference presentations, and other documents are considered grey literature (or gray literature ), defined by GreyNet as "multiple document types produced on all levels of government, academics, business, and [other] organization[s] in electronic and print formats. . .where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body." Grey literature may have editorial or committee oversight, but does not necessarily undergo the process of peer review. Nonetheless, it may have significant scientific value. 
Secondary literature 
 
The secondary literature: 
 
    summarizes and synthesizes the primary literature 
    is both broader and less current than the primary literature 
    is useful for getting an overview of a research area 
    is useful for finding citations to more information on a topic. 
 
Examples of secondary literature in the sciences include: 
 
    literature reviews (or review articles) - More about literature reviews 
    monographs (books dealing with a specific area of research in the sciences) 
 
Tertiary literature 
 
The tertiary literature: 
 
    deals with broad, discipline-level topics in the sciences (like biochemistry or evolution) 
    is a useful starting point for background information on a research topic 
    reports well-established facts in the scientific literature 
    is often not as thoroughly referenced as primary or secondary literature 
 
Examples of tertiary literature in the sciences include: 
 
    encyclopedias 
    textbooks 
    handbooks
