Sanctions on Russia should not affect Iran deal: US

New US sanctions imposed on Russia are not related to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and should not have any impact on a potential revival of that agreement, a US State Department spokesperson said.

“The new Russia-related sanctions are unrelated to the JCPOA and should not have any impact on its potential implementation,” the spokesperson said, referring to the 2015 deal by its formal name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

“We continue to engage with Russia on a return to full implementation of the JCPOA. Russia shares a common interest in ensuring Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon. ”

Ceasefire call by Russia a ‘fiction’: Writer

A UK-based author says Russia’s announcement of the ceasefire in Mariupol was a “fiction”, adding Moscow was following a “script” similar to its actions in Syria.

“Russia has repeated a very familiar script to set these [ceasefires] up and entice people into leaving the city into evacuating through what was supposed to be a safe corridor, and then tried to shell them in order to bottleneck as many people as possible into an area that was going to come under attack,” Keir Giles of the Conflict Studies Research Centre in London told Al Jazeera from Northamptonshire.

“Fortunately, it appears that Ukrainian authorities – who already let’s not forget have been at war with Russia for eight years, and probably knew what was coming, held back from actually launching all of their civilian evacuees down this humanitarian corridor,” he added.

UK accuse Russia of Mariupol ceasefire plan to reset forces

The United Kingdom said on Saturday that Russia’s proposed ceasefire in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol was probably an attempt to deflect international condemnation while giving itself a chance to reset its forces for a renewed offensive.

Analyst: Russia yet to bring full military force to Ukraine

Military Analyst Mason Clark, of the Institute for the Study of War, explains why Russia has not used its full military force against Ukraine.”It’s frankly miraculous that they have allowed the Ukrainian Air Force to remain operational … when they should have theoretically had the capabilities to ground it very early on in operations,” he told Al Jazeera.

“So a lot of those higher-end Russian capabilities that we would expect, we haven’t actually seen used yet. It doesn’t, of course, mean that they won’t ever be used, and we are beginning to see some indications of Russians using greater tactical airpower,” he said.

“And of course, as is rightly getting a lot of attention, using possible thermobaric munitions and rocket artillery against civilian targets in Kharkiv and elsewhere.”

‘Putin won’t stop’: Ex-Russian deputy foreign minister

Andrei Fedorov, a former deputy foreign minister of Russia, told Al Jazeera Russian President Vladimir Putin’s objective is to surround Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and then give President Volodomyr Zelenskyy an ultimatum.

“He declared a very clear goal that Ukraine, as it is today, should be changed,” Fedorov said from Moscow. “I’ve known him for many years, he will not stop. Most probably, in the next 5-6 days, the military operation will be extended to much more territory, including Odesa,” he predicted.

“The Russian army will surround Kyiv, and then there will be a kind of ultimatum for maybe 24 hours for Zelenskyy to resign, for the government to resign,  to declare something like an interim government or something like this, because from military point of view, it’s very dangerous to start a military attack on Kyiv – it can bring a lot of damages,” Fedorov added.

“Also, let’s not forget that Kiev is playing a very important role in Russia’s history; in Russia it’s called the mother of all Russian cities.”

UN: More than 350 civilians confirmed killed in Ukraine

At least 351 civilians are confirmed to have been killed in Ukraine, a UN monitoring mission said.

“OHCHR believes that the real figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intensive hostilities have been going on was delayed and many reports were still pending corroboration,” it said.

He said a no-fly zone would have “colossal and catastrophic consequences not only for Europe but also the whole world”.
