US Government rejects Polish fighter jet plan

A Polish plan to provide fighter jets to Ukraine will not go ahead as after the US government described it as “not tenable”.

Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau , previously said his government was “ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein airbase and place them at the disposal of the government of the United States of America ”.

However the US Department of Defense said the prospect of the jets departing from the base “to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance ”.

Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said the plan was “not tenable”.

“We will continue to consult with Poland and our other Nato allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” Kirby said.

Any strike against supply lines from NATO members supporting Ukraine with arms and ammunition will be considered an escalation of the conflict, CBC News reports .

NATO’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday that while supply lines inside Ukraine were vulnerable to attack, those leading up to the border fell under the protection of the alliance.

“An attack on NATO territory, on NATO forces, NATO capabilities, that would be an attack on NATO,” Stoltenberg said.

There have been concern among some in US intelligence services that Russia may attempt to stem the flow of support to Ukraine with an airstrike or long-range artillery.

Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty states that an attack on one member state is an attack on all 30 members.

Yum also said it was suspending operations of its 70 KFC company-owned restaurants in the country and finalizing an agreement to suspend all Pizza Hut restaurant operations in Russia, in partnership with its master franchisee.

Yum, which has at least 1,000 KFC and 50 Pizza Hut locations in Russia that are nearly all independent franchisees, said in a post on its website dated Monday that it had “suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia while we continue to assess additional options.”

'Most significant oil shortage since 1990'

With so much western diplomacy focusing on oil supplies, it’s worth having a look at what’s happening to the price on the markets.

The international benchmark Brent crude has risen 2.38% to $131.38 at the start of Wednesday’s trading day after rising steeply on Tuesday thanks to Joe Biden’s ban on Russian imports.

Rystad Energy’s head of oil markets, Bjørnar Tonhaugen, said in a note that the US decision to ban Russian oil imports (mostly unfinished, heavier oils for its refineries) means the price could keep rising for months to come as the market seeks equilibrium.

He warned it could lead to “the most significant oil supply shortage since the 1990 Gulf War (when oil prices doubled)” .

He writes:

    The 4.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of “western” crude imports from Russia in January 2022 cannot be replaced by other sources of oil supply in a short period of time.

    Therefore, oil prices must rise to destroy sufficient demand and incentivize a supply response through higher activity – both of which will happen with a time lag of several months – to rebalance the market at a higher price.

    How high oil prices will need to go depends primarily on how much and for how long the market will need to shun export barrels from Russia and whether other buyers, such as China, will step in to increase its purchases of oil from Russia.

Ukrainian authorities are reporting thousands of people have taken the opportunity to flee the city of Sumy after a humanitarian corridor was established.

Deputy chief of staff Kyrylo Tymoshenko said some 5000 people have been evacuated from Sumy and 1000 cars were able to leave the city.

Those evacuated were mostly women, children and residents of other countries, with a brief video posted to Telegram showing people leaving under the cover of darkness.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced the creation of the humanitarian corridor from Sumy to Poltava in a speech earlier today saying it was “a small faction of what has to be done.

Zelenskiy also alleged Russian forces had fired on civilians attempting to flee.

Images obtained by TV channel Ukraina 24 appear to show widespread destruction in Sumy, where there has reportedly been stiff resistance to the Russian advance.

The US Government may have opposed a Polish plan to ship jet fighters to Ukraine but it will be sending two Patriot anti-missile batteries stationed in Europe to Poland .

State Department Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that as a Nato-member, the move would help secure Poland’s airspace owing to its adjacency to the conflict.

“The main issue is to evaluate what Poland’s immediate needs are in the context of being a neighbor of this conflict,” Nuland said.

Chinese President calls for "maximum restraint" over Ukraine

Chinese President Xi Jinping called for “maximum restraint” in Ukraine overnight and said China is “pained to see the flames of war reignited in Europe ” in his strongest statement to date on the conflict, Reuters reports.

Xi, speaking at a virtual meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz , said the three countries should jointly support peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.

Xi described the situation in Ukraine as “worrying” and said the priority should be preventing it from escalating or “spinning out of control”.

He also said France and Germany should make efforts to reduce negative impacts of the crisis, and expressed concern about the impact of sanctions on the stability of global finance, energy supplies, transportation and supply chains.

China, which has refused to condemn Russia’s actions in Ukraine or to call them an invasion, has repeatedly expressed its opposition to what it describes as illegal sanctions on Russia .

China’s friendship with Russia, strengthened last month when President Vladimir Putin attended the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics on the same day that the countries declared a “no limits” strategic partnership, has become awkward for China as the war in Ukraine escalates.

Venezuela has released at least two Americans from jail in an apparent goodwill gesture toward the Biden administration following a visit to Caracas by a high-level US delegation, Reuters reports.

One of the freed prisoners was Gustavo Cardenas, who was among six Citgo oil executives arrested in 2017 and convicted on charges the US government says were fabricated, the sources said. The other was a Cuban American detained on unrelated charges, they said.

The weekend meetings focused not only on the fate of Americans held in Venezuela, but on the possibility of easing US oil sanctions on the Opec member, which is a close Russian ally, to fill the supply gap if Joe Biden banned Russian oil imports in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine
- something that he did on Tuesday.

Venezuela has the world’s biggest proven oil reserves but years of sanctions and neglect mean it is not even in the top 10 of producers .

Former Ukrainian MP Hopko Hanna has broken down into tears during a heart-breaking interview with US television news service MSNBC.

The Chairwoman of Democracy in Action conference repeated calls for a no-fly zone to be imposed over Ukraine - a request that has so far been refused owing the risk it may involve more countries in the conflict.

Ukraine’s energy minister says Russian military units are allegedly “torturing” staff at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to force them into making a public statement.

Herman Halushchenko made the allegation in a social media post where he said operating staff had been “held hostage for four days”.

“There are about 500 Russian soldiers and 50 units of heavy equipment inside the station. The employees of the station are physically and psychologically exhausted,” Halushchenko said.

It is not the only such allegation by the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian general staff has also accused Russian military personnel of violence against civilians, looting and setting up firing positions above bunkers and carrying out psychological operations on residents in Kherson and Mykolaiv .
