Description 
Regression equations are used in both forestry and ecosystem studies to estimate tree biomass from field measurements of dbh (diameter at breast height) or a combination of dbh and height. Literature on biomass is reviewed, and 178 sets of publish equation for 25 species common to the Northeastern Unites States are listed. On the basis of these equations, estimates of aboveground oven-dry weight of trees from 2.5 to 50.0 cm db for each species are presented and discussed. When the general estimates of standing crop are required for commercial purposed or for assessment of nutrient removal by tree harvest, the published equations may be used with precaution instead of developing new equations. When statistical comparisons of productivity or the ecology of site types are required, published equations are not suitable and development of site-specific equations is recommended
